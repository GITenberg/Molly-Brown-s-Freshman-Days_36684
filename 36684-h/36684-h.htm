<h1>Molly Brown&rsquo;s Freshman Days</h1>


<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />

<small>WELLINGTON.</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Wellington! Wellington!&rdquo; called the conductor.</p>

<p>The train drew up at a platform, and as if by
magic a stream of girls came pouring out of the
pretty stucco station with its sloping red roof
and mingled with another stream of girls emptying
itself from the coaches. Everywhere appeared
girls,&mdash;leaping from omnibuses; hurrying
down the gravel walk from the village; hastening
along the University drive; girls on foot; girls
on bicycles; girls running, and girls strolling arm
in arm.</p>

<p>Few of them wore hats; many of them wore
sweaters and short walking skirts of white duck
or serge, and across the front of each sweater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
was embroidered a large &ldquo;W&rdquo; in cadet blue, the
mystic color of Wellington University.</p>

<p>In the midst of a shouting, gesticulating mob
stood Mr. Murphy, baggage master, smiling
good naturedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, young ladies, one at a time, please.
We&rsquo;ve brought down all the baggage left over
by the 9.45. If your trunk ain&rsquo;t on this train,
it&rsquo;ll come on the next. All in good time, please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A tall girl with auburn hair and deep blue eyes
approached the group. There was a kind of awkward
grace about her, the grace which was hers
by rights and the awkwardness which comes of
growing too fast. She wore a shabby brown
homespun suit, a shade darker than her hair, and
on her head was an old brown felt which had
plainly seen service the year before.</p>

<p>But knotted at her neck was a tie of burnt-orange
silk which seemed to draw attention away
from the shiny seams and frayed hem and to cry
aloud:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at me. I am the color of a winter sunset.
Never mind the other old togs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Surely there was something very brave and
jaunty about this young girl who now pushed her
way through the crowd of students and endeavored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
to engage the attention of the baggage-master.</p>

<p><a href="#frontispiece">&ldquo;I think my trunk was on this train,&rdquo; she said</a>
timidly. &ldquo;I hope it is. It came from Louisville
to Philadelphia safely, and when I re-checked it
they told me it would be on this train.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, Murphy, the baggage master, had his
own peculiar method of conducting business, and
it was strictly a partial and prejudiced one. If
he liked the face of a student, he always waited
on her first, regardless of how many other students
were ahead of her; and, as he told his wife
later, he &ldquo;took a fancy to that overgrown gal
from the fust.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, but Mr. Murphy is engaged,&rdquo;
put in a haughty looking young woman
with black eyes that snapped angrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Miss Judith,&rdquo; said the baggage master,
who knew many of the students by name, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
go fer to git excited. I ain&rsquo;t made no promises
to no one. It&rsquo;s plain to see this here young lady
is a newcomer, and, as sich, she gits my fust consideration.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, please excuse me,&rdquo; said the girl in shabby
brown. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not used to&mdash;I mean I haven&rsquo;t traveled
very much.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>Judith turned irritably away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think you hadn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said in a low
voice, but loud enough to be overheard. &ldquo;Freshies
have a lot to learn and one is to respect their
elders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The new girl put down her straw suit case and
leaned against the wall of the station. She looked
tired and there was a streak of soot across her
cheek. The trip from Kentucky in this warm
September weather was not the pleasantest journey
in the world. While she waited for Mr. Murphy
to return with news of her trunk, her attention
was claimed by two girls standing at her
elbow who were talking cheerfully together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said one of them, a plump, brown-eyed
girl with brown hair, a slightly turned-up nose
and a humorous twitch to her lips, &ldquo;I have a
room at Queen&rsquo;s cottage. It&rsquo;s the best I could
do unless I went into one of the expensive suites
in the dormitories, and you know I might as well
expect to take the royal suite on the Mauretania
and sail for Europe as do that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other girl laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d be quite up to doing anything with
your enterprising ways, Nance Oldham,&rdquo; she exclaimed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, are you going to Queen&rsquo;s cottage?&rdquo; here
broke in the girl in shabby brown. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m there,
too. My name is Molly Brown. I come from
Kentucky. I feel awfully forlorn and homesick
arriving at the University station without knowing
a soul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a kind of ringing note to Molly
Brown&rsquo;s voice which made the other girls listen
more closely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if she doesn&rsquo;t sing,&rdquo; thought Nance
Oldham, giving her a quick, scrutinizing glance.
&ldquo;Yes, I am at Queen&rsquo;s cottage,&rdquo; she continued
aloud, &ldquo;but that&rsquo;s about all I can tell you. I feel
like a greeny, too. We&rsquo;ll soon learn, I suppose.
This is Miss Brinton, Miss Brown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Caroline Brinton was rather a nondescript
young person with dreamy eyes and an absent-minded
manner. She came from Philadelphia,
and she greeted the new acquaintance rather
coldly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your trunk ain&rsquo;t here, yet, Miss,&rdquo; called the
baggage master. &ldquo;Like enough it&rsquo;ll come on the
6.50.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly looked disturbed, while the black-eyed
Judith standing nearby flashed a triumphant
smile, as much as to say:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It only serves you right for pushing in out
of turn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are we to do now?&rdquo; she asked of her
new friends, rather helplessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take the &rsquo;bus up to Wellington,&rdquo; said brisk
Nance Oldham. &ldquo;I know that much. There&rsquo;s
one filling up now. We&rsquo;d better hurry and get
seats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The three girls crowded into the long, narrow
side-seated vehicle already half filled with students.
Even at this early stage in their acquaintance,
the bonds of loneliness and sympathy had
drawn them together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a stranger in a strange land,&rdquo; Molly
Brown had confided to the listening ear of Nance
Oldham. &ldquo;I had made up my mind not to be
homesick. I really didn&rsquo;t know what the feeling
was like, because I have never had a chance to
learn. But I know now it&rsquo;s a kind of an all-gone
sensation. I suppose little orphans have it when
they first go into an orphan asylum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll soon get over it,&rdquo; answered Nance.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because you live so far away. Kentucky,
didn&rsquo;t you say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly nodded and looked the other way. The
memory of an old brick house with broad piazzas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
and many windows blurred her vision for a moment.
But she resolutely pressed her lips together
and began to watch the passing scenery,
as new and strange to her as the scenery in a
foreign land.</p>

<p>The road leading to Wellington University
skirted a pretty village and then plunged straight
into the country between rolling meadow lands
tinged a golden brown with the autumn sun.
And there in the distance were the gray towers
of Wellington, silhouetted against the sky like a
mediæval castle.</p>

<p>Molly Brown clasped her hands and smiled a
heavenly smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that it?&rdquo; she exclaimed rapturously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be,&rdquo; answered Nance, who also felt
some quiet and reserved flutterings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said Miss Brinton. &ldquo;I came down to
engage my room, so I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the meantime, there was a busy conversation
going on around them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to cut gym this year. It interferes
too much,&rdquo; exclaimed a tiny girl with birdlike
motions and intelligent, beady little eyes as bright
and alert as the eyes of a little brown bird.</p>

<p>But evidently Molly was not the only person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
who had noticed this resemblance, for one of the
students called out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Jennie Wren, you must admit that gym
never had any charms for you and it&rsquo;s a great
relief to give it up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course she must,&rdquo; put in another girl.
&ldquo;The only exercise Jennie Wren ever takes is to
hop about on the lawn and prune her feathers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; cried Jennie Wren. &ldquo;I never wear
them, not even quills. I belong to the S.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;A.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there much out-of-door life here?&rdquo; asked
Molly Brown, of a tall, somewhat older girl sitting
opposite her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This new girl may have timid manners,&rdquo;
thought Nance Oldham; &ldquo;but she is not afraid to
talk to strangers. I suppose that&rsquo;s the friendly
Southern way. She hasn&rsquo;t been in Wellington
a quarter of an hour and she has already made
three friends,&mdash;Caroline and the station-master
and me. And now she&rsquo;s getting on famously
with that older girl. What I like about her is
that she isn&rsquo;t a bit self-conscious and she takes it
for granted everybody&rsquo;s going to be kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, lots of it,&rdquo; the older girl was saying
to Molly kindly. &ldquo;If you have a taste for that
kind of thing, you may indulge it to your heart&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
content. There is a splendid swimming pool attached
to the gym, and there are golf links, of
course. You know they are quite famous in this
part of the world. Then, there are the tennis
courts, and we&rsquo;ll still have some canoeing on
the lake before the weather gets too cold and
later glorious skating. Besides all that, there
are perfectly ripping walks for miles around. The
college has several Saturday afternoon walking
clubs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t these things interfere with&mdash;with
lectures?&rdquo; asked Molly, who was really quite ignorant
regarding college life, although she had
passed her entrance examinations without any
conditions whatever.</p>

<p>The older girl laughed pleasantly. She was
not good looking, but she had a fine face and
Molly liked her immensely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, you&rsquo;ll find there&rsquo;s plenty of time for
everything you want to get in, because most
things have their season, and most girls specialize,
anyhow. A golf fiend is seldom a tennis
fiend, and there are lots of walking fiends who
don&rsquo;t like either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly&rsquo;s liking for this big girl and her grave,
fine face increased as the conversation progressed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
She had a most reassuring, kindly
manner and Molly noticed that the other girls
treated her with a kind of deferential respect
and called her &ldquo;Miss Stewart.&rdquo; She learned
afterward that Miss Stewart was a senior and
a member of the &ldquo;Octogons,&rdquo; the most coveted
society in the University. She led in all the athletic
sports, was quite a wonderful musician and
had composed an operetta for her class and most
of the music for the class songs. It was whispered
also that she was very rich, though no one
would ever have guessed this secret from Mary
Stewart herself, who was careful never to allude
to money and dressed very simply and
plainly.</p>

<p>The omnibus now turned into the avenue which
led to the college campus and there was general
excitement of a subdued sort among the new
girls and greetings and calls from the older girls
as they caught glimpses of friends strolling on
the lawn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Queen&rsquo;s Cottage,&rdquo; called the driver and Molly
stood up promptly, shrinking a little as twenty
pairs of eyes turned curiously in her direction.</p>

<p>Then the big girl leaned over and took her
hand kindly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you look me up to-morrow?&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;My name is Mary Stewart, and I stop at No.
16 on the Quadrangle. Perhaps I can help you
get things straightened out a bit and show you
the ropes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you,&rdquo; said Molly, with that musical
ring to her voice which never failed to thrill
her hearers. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s awfully nice of you. What
time shall I come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you in Chapel in the morning, and
we&rsquo;ll fix the time then,&rdquo; called Miss Stewart as
Molly climbed out, dragging her straw telescope
over the knees of the other passengers, followed
by Nance Oldham, who had waited for her to
take the initiative.</p>

<p>As the two girls stood watching the disappearing
vehicle, they became the prey to the most
extreme loneliness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel as if I had just left the tumbrel on the
way to my execution,&rdquo; observed Molly, trying to
laugh, although the corners of her mouth turned
persistently down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, anyway, I&rsquo;m glad we are together,&rdquo; she
continued, slipping her arm through Nance&rsquo;s.
&ldquo;Queen&rsquo;s Cottage does seem so remote and lonesome,
doesn&rsquo;t it? Just a thing apart.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>The two girls gazed uncertainly at the rather
dismal-looking shingled house, stained brown
and covered with a mantle of old vines which appeared
to have been prematurely stripped of their
foliage. It was somewhat isolated, at least it
seemed so at first. The next house was quite
half a block on and was a cheerful place, all
stucco and red roof like the station.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, here goes,&rdquo; Molly went on. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s
Queen&rsquo;s, why then, so be it,&rdquo; and she marched
up the walk and rang the front door bell, which
resounded through the hall with a metallic clang.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shure, I&rsquo;m after bein&rsquo; wit&rsquo; you in a moment,&rdquo;
called a voice from above. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the new
young ladies, I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo;, and glad I am to see
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was the sound of heavy footsteps down
the stairs and the door was opened by Mrs. Murphy,
wife of the baggage master and housekeeper
for Queen&rsquo;s Cottage. She was a middle-aged
Irish woman with a round, good-natured face
and she beamed on the girls with motherly interest
as she ushered them into the parlor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since ye be the fust comers, ye may be the
fust choosers,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and if ye be friends, ye
may like to be roommates, surely, and that&rsquo;s a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
good thing. It&rsquo;s better to room with a friend
than a stranger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two girls looked at each other with a new
interest. It had not occurred to them that they
might be roommates, but had not they already,
with the swiftness peculiar to girls, bridged the
gulf which separates total strangers, and were
now on the very verge of plunging into intimate
friendship? Would it not be better to seize this
opportunity than to wait for other chances which
might not prove so agreeable?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall we not?&rdquo; asked Molly with that charming,
cordial manner which appeared to win her
friends wherever she went.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be a great relief,&rdquo; answered Nance,
who was yet to learn the value of showing real
pleasure when she felt it. Nevertheless, Nance,
under her whimsical, rather sarcastic outer shell,
had a warm and loyal heart.</p>

<p>Thus Molly Brown and Nance Oldham, quite
opposites in looks and temperaments, became
roommates during their freshman year at Wellington
College and thus, from this small beginning,
the seeds of a life-long friendship were
sown.</p>

<p>The two girls chose a big sunny room on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
third floor looking over a portion of the golf
links. Molly liked it because it had blue wallpaper
and Nance because it had a really commodious
closet.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />

<small>THEIR NEIGHBOR.</small></h2>


<p>Molly Brown was the youngest member of a
numerous family of older brothers and sisters.
Her father had been dead many years, and in order
to rear and educate her children, Mrs. Brown
had been obliged to mortgage, acre by acre, the
fine old place where Molly and her brothers and
sisters had been born and brought up. Every
time anybody in the Brown family wanted to do
anything that was particularly nice, something
had to go, either a cow or a colt or a piece of
land, according to the needs of the moment. A
two-acre lot represented Molly&rsquo;s college education&mdash;two
perfectly good acres of orchard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t bring back at least one golden
apple in return for all these nice juicy ones that
are going for your education, Molly, you are no
child of mine,&rdquo; Mrs. Brown had laughingly exclaimed
when she kissed her daughter good-bye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring back the three golden apples of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Hesperides, mother, and make the family rich
and happy,&rdquo; cried Molly, and from that moment
the three golden apples became a secret symbol
to her, although she had not decided in her mind
exactly what they represented.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; as Molly observed to herself, &ldquo;anybody
who has had two acres of winter sweets, pippins
and greenings spent on her, must necessarily engage
to win a few.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Those two fruitful acres, however, while they
provided a fund for an education, did not extend
far into the margin and there was little left for
clothes. That was perhaps one of the reasons
why Molly had felt so disturbed about the delay
in receiving her trunk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can stand traveling in this old brown rag
for economy&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; she thought; &ldquo;but I would
like to put on the one decent thing I own for my
first day at college. I was a chump not to have
brought something in my suit case besides a
blouse. However, what&rsquo;s done can&rsquo;t be undone,&rdquo;
and she stoically went to work to remove the
stains of travel and put on a fresh blue linen
shirtwaist; while Nance Oldham, who had been
more far-sighted, made herself spic and span in
a duck skirt and a white linen blouse. She had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
little to say during the process of making her
toilet, and Molly wondered if, after all, she would
like a roommate so peculiarly reserved and whimsical
as this new friend. She hoped there would
be lots of nice girls in the house of the right
sort, girls who meant business, for while Molly
meant to enjoy herself immensely, she meant
business decidedly, and she didn&rsquo;t want to get into
a play set and be torn away from her studies.
As these thoughts flitted through her mind she
heard voices coming up the stairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Mrs. Murphy, I do hope you&rsquo;ve got
something really decent. You know, I hadn&rsquo;t expected
to come back this year. I thought I would
stay in France with grandmamma, but at the last
moment I changed my mind, and I&rsquo;ve come right
here from the ship without engaging a thing at
all. I&rsquo;ll take anything that&rsquo;s a single.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The voice had a spoiled, imperious sound, like
that of a person in the habit of having her own
way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a single, Miss, but it&rsquo;s a small one, and
they do say you&rsquo;ve got a deal of belongings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see it. Let&rsquo;s see it, quick, Granny Murphy,&rdquo;
and from the noise without our two young
persons judged that this despotic stranger had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
placed her hands on Mrs. Murphy&rsquo;s shoulders and
was running her along the passage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, you&rsquo;ll be giving me apoplexy, Miss,
surely, with your goings-on,&rdquo; cried the woman
breathlessly, as she opened the door next theirs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s in there? Two freshies?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss. They only just arrived an hour
ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Greenies from Greenville, Green County,&rdquo;
chanted the young woman, who did not seem to
mind being overheard by the entire household.
&ldquo;Very well, I&rsquo;ll take this little hole-in-the-wall.
I won&rsquo;t move any of my things in, except some
books and cushions. And now, off wit&rsquo; yer.
Here&rsquo;s something for your trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you, thank you, Miss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two girls seemed to hear the Irish woman
being shoved out in the hall. Then the door was
banged after her and was locked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me, what an obstreperous person,&rdquo; observed
Nance. &ldquo;I wonder if she&rsquo;s going to give
us a continuous performance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered Molly. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be a
noisy neighbor if she does. But she sounds interesting,
living in France with her grandmamma
and so on.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>Nance glanced at her watch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to go for a stroll before
supper? We have an hour yet. I&rsquo;m dying to
see the famous Quadrangle and the Cloisters and
a few other celebrated spots I&rsquo;ve heard about.
Aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And incidentally rub off a little of our greenness,&rdquo;
said Molly, recalling the words of the girl
next door.</p>

<p>As the two girls closed the door to their room
and paused on the landing, the door adjoining
burst open and a human whirlwind blew out of
the single room and almost knocked them over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said Nance stiffly, giving
the human whirlwind a long, cool, brown glance.</p>

<p>Molly, a little behind her friend, examined the
stranger with much curiosity. She could not
quite tell why she had imagined her to be a small
black-eyed, black-haired person, when here stood
a tall, very beautiful young woman. Her hair
was light brown and perfectly straight. She had
peculiarly passionate, fiery eyes of very dark
gray, of the &ldquo;smouldering kind,&rdquo; as Nance described
them later; her features were regular and
her mouth so expressive of her humors that her
friends could almost read her thoughts by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
curve of her sensitive lips. Even in that flashing
glimpse the girls could see that she was beautifully
dressed in a white serge suit and a stunning
hat of dull blue, trimmed with wings.</p>

<p>But instead of continuing her mad rush, which
seemed to be her usual manner of doing things,
the young woman became suddenly a zephyr of
mildness and gentleness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse my precipitate methods,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
never do things slowly, even when there&rsquo;s no occasion
to hurry. It&rsquo;s my way, I suppose. Are
you freshmen? Perhaps you&rsquo;d like for me to
show you around college. I&rsquo;m a soph. I&rsquo;m fairly
familiar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nance pressed her lips together. She was not
in the habit of making friends off-hand. Molly,
in fact, was almost her first experience in this
kind of friendship. But Molly Brown, who had
never consciously done a rude thing in her life,
exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;That would be awfully nice. Thanks, we&rsquo;ll
come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They followed her rather timidly down the
steps. Across the campus the pile of gray buildings,
in the September twilight, more than ever
resembled a fine old castle. As they hastened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
along, the sophomore gave them each a quick,
comprehensive glance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name is Frances Andrews,&rdquo; she began
suddenly, and added with a peculiar intonation,
&ldquo;I was called &lsquo;Frank&rsquo; last year. I&rsquo;m so glad we
are to be neighbors. I hope we shall have lots
of good times together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly considered this a particular mark of
good nature on the part of an older girl to two
freshmen, and she promptly made known their
names to Frances Andrews. All this time Nance
had remained impassive and quiet.</p>

<p>Ten girls, arm in arm, were strolling toward
them across the soft green turf of the campus,
singing as in one voice to the tune of &ldquo;Maryland,
My Maryland&rdquo;:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;Oh, Wellington, My Wellington,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, how I love my Wellington!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Suddenly Frances Andrews, who was walking
between the two young girls, took them each
firmly by the arm and led them straight across
the campus, giving the ten girls a wide berth.
There was so much fierce determination in her
action that Molly and Nance looked at her with
amazement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Are those seniors?&rdquo; asked Nance, thinking
perhaps it was not college etiquette to break
through a line of established and dignified characters
like seniors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; they are sophomores singing their class
song,&rdquo; answered Frances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you a sophomore?&rdquo; demanded Nance
quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Curious she doesn&rsquo;t want to meet her
friends,&rdquo; thought Molly.</p>

<p>But there were more interesting sights to occupy
her attention just then.</p>

<p>They had reached the great gray stone archway
which formed the entrance to the Quadrangle,
a grassy courtyard enclosed on all sides by
the walls of the building. Heavy oak doors of an
antique design opened straight onto the court
from the various corridors and lecture rooms and
at one end was the library, a beautiful room with
a groined roof and stained glass windows, like
a chapel. Low stone benches were ranged along
the arcade of the court, whereon sat numerous
girls laughing and talking together.</p>

<p>Although she considered that undue honors
were being paid them by having as guide this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
dashing sophomore, somehow Molly still felt the
icy grip of homesickness on her heart. Nance
seemed so unsympathetic and reserved and there
was a kind of hardness about this Frances Andrews
that made the warm-hearted, affectionate
Molly a bit uncomfortable. Suddenly Nance
spied her old friend, Caroline Brinton, in the
distance, and rushed over to join her. As she
left, three girls came toward them, talking animatedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, Jennie Wren!&rdquo; called Frances gayly.
It was the same little bird-like person who had
been in the bus. &ldquo;Howdy, Rosamond. How are
you, Lotta? It&rsquo;s awfully nice to be back at the
old stand again. Let me introduce you to my new
almost-roommate, Miss Brown,&rdquo; went on Frances
hurriedly, as if to fill up the gaps of silence which
greeted them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Miss Andrews,&rdquo; said Jennie
Wren, stiffly.</p>

<p>Rosamond Chase, who had a plump figure and
a round, good-natured face, was slightly warmer
in her greeting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are you, Frankie? I thought you were
going to France this winter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other girl who had a turned-up nose and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
blonde hair, and was called &ldquo;Peggy Parsons,&rdquo;
sniffed slightly and put her hands behind her
back as if she wished to avoid shaking hands.</p>

<p>Molly was so shocked that she felt the tears
rising to her eyes. &ldquo;I wish I had never come to
college,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;if this is the way old
friends treat each other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She slipped her arm through Frances Andrews&rsquo;
and gave it a sympathetic squeeze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you show me the Cloisters?&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pining to see what they are like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; said Frances, quite cheerfully,
in spite of the fact that she had just been snubbed
by three of her own classmates.</p>

<p>Lifting the latch of a small oak door fitted
under a pointed arch, she led the way through
a passage to another oak door which opened directly
on the Cloisters. Molly gave an exclamation
of pleasure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;are we really allowed to walk
in this wonderful place?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As much as you like before six P.&nbsp;M.,&rdquo; answered
Frances. &ldquo;How do you do, Miss Pembroke?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A tall woman with a grave, handsome face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
was waiting under the arched arcade to go
through the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you decided to come back to us, Miss Andrews.
I&rsquo;m very glad of it. Come into my office
a moment. I want a few words with you before
supper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can find your way back to Queen&rsquo;s by
yourself, can&rsquo;t you, Miss Brown?&rdquo; asked Frances.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And in another moment, Molly Brown was
quite alone in the Cloisters. She was glad to be
alone. She wanted to think. She paced slowly
along the cloistered walk, each stone arch of
which framed a picture of the grassy court with
an Italian fountain in the center.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s exactly like an old monastery,&rdquo; she said
to herself. &ldquo;I wonder anybody could ever be
frivolous or flippant in such an old world spot
as this. I could easily imagine myself a monk,
telling my beads.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She sat down on a stone bench and folded her
hands meditatively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So far, I&rsquo;ve really only made one friend at
college,&rdquo; she thought to herself, for Nance Oldham
was too reserved to be called a friend yet,
&ldquo;and that friend is Frances Andrews. Who is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
she? What is she? Why do her classmates
snub her and why did Miss Pembroke, who
belonged to the faculty, wish to speak with
her in her private office?&rdquo; It was all queer, very
queer. Somehow, it seemed to Molly now that
what she had taken for whirlwind manners was
really a tremendous excitement under which
Frances Andrews was laboring. She was trying
to brazen out something.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just the same, I&rsquo;m sorry for her,&rdquo; she said
out loud.</p>

<p>At that moment, a musical, deep-throated bell
boomed out six times in the stillness of the cloisters.
There was the sound of a door opening, a
pause and the door closed with a clicking noise.
Molly started from her reverie. It was six
o&rsquo;clock. She rushed to the door of antique design
through which she had entered just fifteen
minutes before. It was closed and locked securely.
She knocked loudly and called:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me out! Let me out! I&rsquo;m locked in!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she waited, but no one answered. In the
stillness of the twilit courtyard she could hear
the sounds of laughter and talking from the
Quadrangle. They grew fainter and fainter. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
gray chill settled down over the place and Molly
looked about her with a feeling of utter desolation.
She had been locked in the Cloisters for
the night.</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />

<small>THE PROFESSOR.</small></h2>


<p>Molly beat and kicked on the door wildly. Then
she called again and again but her voice came
back to her in a ghostly echo through the dim
aisles of the cloistered walk. She sat down on a
bench and burst into tears.</p>

<p>How tired and hungry and homesick she was!
How she wished she had never heard of college,
cold, unfriendly place where people insulted old
friends and they locked doors at six o&rsquo;clock. The
chill of the evening had fallen and the stars were
beginning to show themselves in the square of
blue over the Cloisters. Molly shivered and folded
her arms. She had not worn her coat and her
blue linen blouse was damp with dew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can this be the only door into the Cloisters?&rdquo;
she thought after the first attack of homesick
weeping had passed.</p>

<p>She rose and began to search along the arcade
which was now almost black. There were doors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
at intervals but all of them locked. She knocked
on each one and waited patiently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, heavens, let me get out of this place to-night,&rdquo;
she prayed, lifting her eyes to the stars
with an agonized expression. Suddenly, the high
mullioned window under which she was standing,
glowed with a light just struck. Then, someone
opened a casement and a man&rsquo;s voice called:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is anyone there? I thought I heard a cry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said Molly, trying to stifle the sobs
that would rise in her throat. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been locked
in, or rather out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you poor child,&rdquo; exclaimed the voice
again. &ldquo;Wait a moment and I&rsquo;ll open the
door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were sounds of steps along the passage;
a heavy bolt was thrust back and a door held
open while Molly rushed into the passage like a
frightened bird out of the dark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s lucky I happened to be in my study this
evening,&rdquo; said the man, leading the way toward
a square of light in the dark corridor. &ldquo;Of
course the night watchman would have made his
rounds at eight, but an hour&rsquo;s suspense out there
in the cold and dark would have been very disagreeable.
How in the world did it happen?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>By this time they had reached the study and
Molly found herself in a cozy little room lined
from ceiling to floor with books. On the desk
was a tray of supper. The owner of the study
was a studious looking young man with kindly,
quizzical brown eyes under shaggy eyebrows, a
firm mouth and a cleft in his chin, which Molly
had always heard was a mark of beauty in a
woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must be a freshman?&rdquo; he said looking at
her with a shade of amusement in his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; replied Molly, bravely trying to keep
her voice from shaking. &ldquo;I only arrived an hour
or so ago. I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t know they would lock&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
She broke down altogether and slipping into a big
wicker chair sobbed bitterly. &ldquo;Oh, I wish&mdash;I
wish I&rsquo;d stayed at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you poor little girl,&rdquo; exclaimed the man.
&ldquo;You have had a beastly time for your first day
at college, but you&rsquo;ll come to like it better and
better all the time. Come, dry your eyes and I&rsquo;ll
start you on your way to your lodgings. Where
are you stopping?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Queen&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose you drink some hot soup before you
go. It will warm you up,&rdquo; he added kindly, taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
a cup of hot bouillon from the tray and placing
it on the arm of her chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s your supper,&rdquo; stammered Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, there&rsquo;s plenty more. Do as I tell
you,&rdquo; he ordered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a professor, you know,
so you&rsquo;ll have to obey me or I&rsquo;ll scold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly drank the soup without a word. It did
comfort her considerably and presently she looked
up at the professor and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right now. I hope you&rsquo;ll excuse me
for being so silly and weak. You see I felt so
far away and lonesome and it&rsquo;s an awful feeling
to be locked out in the cold about a thousand
miles from home. I never was before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I should have felt the same in your
place,&rdquo; answered the professor. &ldquo;I should probably
have imagined I saw the ghosts of monks
dead and gone, who might have walked there if
the Cloisters had been several hundreds of years
older, and I would certainly have made the echoes
ring with my calls for help. The Cloisters are
all right for &lsquo;concentration&rsquo; and &lsquo;meditation,&rsquo;
which I believe is what they are intended to be
used for on a warm, sunny day; but they are cold
comfort after sunset.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this your study?&rdquo; asked Molly, rising and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
looking about her with interest, as she started
toward the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should say that this was my play room,&rdquo; he
replied, smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Play room?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, this is where I hide from work and begin
to play.&rdquo; He glanced at a pile of manuscript
on his desk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon work is play and play is work to
you,&rdquo; observed Molly, regarding the papers with
much interest. She had never before seen a
manuscript.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you knew what an heretical document that
was, you would not make such rash statements,&rdquo;
said the professor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s a learned treatise on some scientific
subject,&rdquo; laughed Molly, who had entirely regained
her composure now, and felt not the least
bit afraid of this learned man, with the kind,
brown eyes. He seemed quite old to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I tell you what it is, will you promise to
keep it a secret?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I promise,&rdquo; she cried eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the libretto of a light opera,&rdquo; he said
solemnly, enjoying her amazement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you write it?&rdquo; she asked breathlessly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Not the music, but the words and the lyrics.
Now, I&rsquo;ve told you my only secret,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You
must never give me away, or the bottom would
fall out of the chair of English literature at Wellington
College.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall never, never tell,&rdquo; exclaimed Molly;
&ldquo;and thank you ever so much for your kindness
to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They clasped hands and the professor opened
the door for her and stood back to let her pass.</p>

<p>Then he followed her down the passage to another
door, which he also opened, and in the dim
light she still noticed that quizzical look in his
eyes, which made her wonder whether he was
laughing at her in particular, or at things in
general.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you find your way to Queen&rsquo;s Cottage?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; she assured him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the last
house on the left of the campus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next moment she found herself running
along the deserted Quadrangle walk. Under the
archway she flew, and straight across the campus&mdash;home.</p>

<p>It was not yet seven o&rsquo;clock, and the Queen&rsquo;s
Cottage girls were still at supper. A number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
students had arrived during the afternoon and
the table was full. There were several freshmen;
Molly identified them by their silence and
looks of unaccustomedness, and some older girls,
who were chattering together like magpies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where have you been?&rdquo; demanded Nance
Oldham, who had saved a seat for her roommate
next to her own.</p>

<p>All conversation ceased, and every eye in the
room was turned on blushing Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been locked up,&rdquo; she answered faintly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Locked up?&rdquo; repeated several voices at once.
&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the Cloisters. I didn&rsquo;t realize it was six
o&rsquo;clock, and some one locked the door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly had been prepared for a good deal of
amusement at her expense, and she felt very
grateful when, instead of hoots of derision, a
nice junior named Sallie Marks, with an interesting
face and good dark eyes, exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you poor little freshie! What a mediæval
adventure for your first day. And how did
you finally get out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of the professors heard me call and let
me out.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Which one?&rdquo; demanded several voices at
once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know his name,&rdquo; replied Molly guardedly,
remembering that she had a secret to keep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did he look like?&rdquo; demanded Frances
Andrews, who had been unusually silent for her
until now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He had brown eyes and a smooth face and
reddish hair, and he was middle aged and quite
nice,&rdquo; said Molly glibly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, you don&rsquo;t mean to say it was Epiménides
Antinous Green?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; demanded Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind, don&rsquo;t let them guy you,&rdquo; said
Sallie Marks. &ldquo;It was evidently Professor Edwin
Green who let you in. He is professor of
English literature, and I&rsquo;ll tell you for your enlightenment
that he was nicknamed in a song
&lsquo;Epiménides&rsquo; after a Greek philosopher, who
went to sleep when he was a boy and woke up
middle-aged and very wise, and &lsquo;Antinous&rsquo; after
a very handsome Greek youth. Don&rsquo;t you think
him good-looking?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rather, for an older person,&rdquo; said Molly
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not thirty yet, my child,&rdquo; said Frances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Andrews. &ldquo;At least, so they say, and he&rsquo;s so
clever that two other colleges are after him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he&rsquo;s written two books,&rdquo; went on Sally.
&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you heard of them&mdash;&lsquo;Philosophical Essays&rsquo;
and &lsquo;Lyric Poetry.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly was obliged to confess her ignorance
regarding Professor Edwin Green&rsquo;s outbursts
into literature, but she indulged in an inward
mental smile, remembering the lyrics in the comic
opera libretto.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been to Harvard and Oxford, and studied
in France. He&rsquo;s a perfect infant prodigy,&rdquo;
went on another girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a ripping thing for the &lsquo;Squib,&rsquo;&rdquo; Molly
heard another girl whisper to her neighbor.</p>

<p>She knew she would be the subject of an everlasting
joke, but she hoped to live it down by
learning immediately everything there was to
know about Wellington, and becoming so wise
that nobody would ever accuse her again of being
a green freshman.</p>

<p>Mrs. Maynard, the matron, came in to see if
she was all right. She was a motherly little
woman, with a gentle manner, and Molly felt a
leaning toward her at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll feel comfortable in your new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
quarters,&rdquo; said Mrs. Maynard. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have
plenty of sunshine and a good deal more space
when you get your trunks unpacked, although
the things inside a trunk do sometimes look bigger
than the trunk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly smiled. There was not much in her
trunk to take up space, most certainly. She
had nicknamed herself when she packed it &ldquo;Molly
Few Clothes,&rdquo; and she was beginning to wonder
if even those few would pass muster in that
crowd of well-dressed girls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, have the trunks really come, Miss Oldham?&rdquo;
she asked her roommate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, just before supper. I&rsquo;ve started unpacking
mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness. I&rsquo;ve got an old ham and a
hickory nut cake and some beaten biscuits and
pickles and blackberry jam in mine, and I can
hardly wait to see if anything has broken loose
on my clothes, such as they are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nance Oldham opened her eyes wide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always heard that Southern people were
pretty strong on food,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and this proves
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait until you try the hickory nut cake, and
you won&rsquo;t be so scornful,&rdquo; answered Molly, somehow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
not liking this accusation regarding the appetites
of her people.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did I hear the words &lsquo;hickory nut cake&rsquo;
spoken?&rdquo; demanded Frances Andrews, who apparently
talked to no one at the table except
freshmen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I brought some. Come up and try it
to-night,&rdquo; said Molly hospitably.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That would be very jolly, but I can&rsquo;t to-night,
thanks,&rdquo; said Frances, flushing.</p>

<p>And then Molly and Nance noticed that the
other sophomores and juniors at the table were
all perfectly silent and looking at her curiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll all come,&rdquo; she added lamely,
wondering if they were accusing her of inhospitality.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not to-night, my child,&rdquo; said Sally Marks,
rising from the table. &ldquo;Thank you, very much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the two freshmen climbed the stairs to
their room a little later, they passed by an open
door on the landing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; called the voice of Sally. &ldquo;I was
waiting for you to pass. This is my home. How
do you like it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very much,&rdquo; answered the two girls, really
not seeing anything particularly remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
about the apartment, except perhaps the sign on
the door which read &ldquo;Pax Vobiscum,&rdquo; and would
seem to indicate that the owner of the room had
a Christian spirit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your name is &lsquo;Molly Brown,&rsquo; and you come
from Kentucky, isn&rsquo;t that so?&rdquo; asked Sally
Marks, taking Molly&rsquo;s chin in her hand and looking
into her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yours?&rdquo; went on the inquisitive Sally,
turning to Molly&rsquo;s roommate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Nance Oldham, and I come from Vermont,&rdquo;
finished Nance promptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re both dears. And I am ever so glad
you are in Queens. You won&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m patronizing
if I give you a little advice, will you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said the two girls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know Wellington&rsquo;s full of nice girls. I
don&rsquo;t think there is a small college in this country
that has such a fine showing for class and
brains. But among three hundred there are
bound to be some black sheep, and new girls
should always be careful with whom they take
up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how can we tell?&rdquo; asked Nance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, there are ways. Suppose, for instance,
you should meet a girl who was good-looking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
clever, rich, with lots of pretty clothes, and all
that, and she seemed to have no friends. What
would you think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I might think there was something the
matter with her, unless she was too shy to make
friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But suppose she wasn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; persisted Sally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, there would surely be something the
matter,&rdquo; said Nance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, children, if you should meet a
girl like that in college, don&rsquo;t get too intimate
with her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sally Marks led them up to their own room,
just to see how they were fixed, she said.</p>

<p>Later, when the two girls had crawled wearily
into bed, after finishing the unpacking, Molly
called out sleepily:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nance&rdquo;&mdash;she had forgotten already to say
Miss Oldham&mdash;&ldquo;do you suppose that nice junior
could have meant Miss Andrews?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t a doubt of it,&rdquo; said Nance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just the same, I&rsquo;m sorry for the poor thing,&rdquo;
continued Molly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for anybody who&rsquo;s
walking under a cloud, and I don&rsquo;t think it would
do any harm to be nice to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t do her any harm,&rdquo; said Nance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Epiménides Antinous Green,&rdquo; whispered
Molly to herself, as she snuggled under the covers.
The name seemed to stick in her memory
like a rhyme. &ldquo;Funny I didn&rsquo;t notice how young
and handsome he was. I only noticed that he
had good manners, if he did treat me like a
child.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="l1"/>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />

<small>A BUSY DAY.</small></h2>


<p>The next day was always a chaotic one in
Molly&rsquo;s memory&mdash;a jumble of new faces and
strange events. At breakfast she made the acquaintance
of the freshmen who were staying
at Queen&rsquo;s Cottage&mdash;four in all. One of these
was Julia Kean, &ldquo;a nice girl in neutral tints,&rdquo;
as Molly wrote home to her sister, &ldquo;with gray
eyes and brown hair and a sense of humor.&rdquo; She
came to be known as &ldquo;Judy,&rdquo; and formed an intimate
friendship with Molly and Nance, which
lasted throughout the four years of their college
course.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you feel after your night&rsquo;s rest?&rdquo; she
called across the table to Molly in the most
friendly manner, just as if they had known each
other always. &ldquo;You look like the &lsquo;Lady of the
Sea&rsquo; in that blue linen that just matches your
eyes.&rdquo; She began looking Molly over with a
kind of critical admiration, narrowing her eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
as an artist does when he&rsquo;s at work on a picture.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to make a poster of you in blue-and-white
chalk. I&rsquo;d put you on a yellow, sandy
beach, against a bright blue sky, in a high wind,
with your dress and hair blowing&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; And with
eyes still narrowed, she traced an imaginary picture
with one hand and shaped her ideas with the
other.</p>

<p>Molly laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must be an artist,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;with such
notions about posing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A would-be one, that&rsquo;s all. &lsquo;Not yet, but
soon,&rsquo; is my motto.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a bad motto,&rdquo; here put in Nance Oldham.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like the Spanish saying of &lsquo;<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Hasta
mañana</i>.&rsquo; You are very apt to put off doing
things until next day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Julia Kean looked at her reproachfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve read my character in two words,&rdquo;
she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you introduce me to your friends,
Judy?&rdquo; asked a handsome girl next to her, who
had quantities of light-brown hair piled on top
of her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been introduced myself,&rdquo; replied
Judy; &ldquo;but I never could see why people should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
stop for introductions at teas and times like this.
We all know we&rsquo;re all right, or else we wouldn&rsquo;t
be here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Frances Andrews, who had
just come in, &ldquo;why all this formality, when we
are to be a family party for the next eight
months? Why not become friends at once, without
any preliminaries?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sally Marks, who had given them the vague
yet meaningful warning the night before, appeared
to be absorbed in her coffee cup, and
the other two sophomores at the table were engaged
in a whispered conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless, I will perform the introductions,&rdquo;
announced Judy Kean. &ldquo;This is Miss
Margaret Wakefield, of Washington, D.&nbsp;C.; Miss
Edith Coles, of Rhode Island; Miss Jessie Lynch,
of Wisconsin, and Miss Mabel Hinton, of Illinois.
As for me, my name is Julia Kean, and I
come from&mdash;nowhere in particular.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must have had a birthplace,&rdquo; insisted
that accurate young person, Nance Oldham.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you could call a ship a birthplace, I did,&rdquo;
replied Judy. &ldquo;I was born in mid-ocean on a
stormy night. Hence my stormy, restless nature.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But how did it happen?&rdquo; asked Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it was all simple enough. Papa and
mamma were on their way back from Japan,
and I arrived a bit prematurely on board ship.
I began life traveling, and I&rsquo;ve been traveling
ever since.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to stay put here; awhile, at least,&rdquo;
said Sally Marks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope so. I need to gather a little moss
before I become an habitual tramp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t we better be chasing along?&rdquo; said
Frances Andrews. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost time for chapel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No one answered and Molly began to wonder
how long this strange girl would endure the part
of a monologist at college. For that was what
her attempts at conversation seemed to amount
to. She admired Frances&rsquo;s pluck, at any rate.
Whatever she had done to offend, it was courageous
of her to come back and face the music.</p>

<p>Chapel was an impressive sight to the new
girls. The entire body of students was there,
and the faculty, including Professor Edwin
Green, who gave each girl the impression he was
looking at her when he was really only gazing
into the imaginary bull&rsquo;s-eye of an imaginary
camera, and saw not one of them. Molly decided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
his comeliness was more charm than looks. &ldquo;The
unknown charm,&rdquo; she wrote her sister. &ldquo;His
ears are a little pointed at the top, and he has
brown eyes like a collie dog. But it was nice of
him to have given me his soup,&rdquo; she added irrelevantly,
&ldquo;and I shall always appreciate it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After chapel, when Molly was following in the
trail of her new friends, feeling a bit strange
and unaccustomed, some one plucked her by the
sleeve. It was Mary Stewart, the nice senior
with the plain, but fine face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll expect you this evening after supper,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m having a little party. There will be
music, too. I thought perhaps you might like
to bring a friend along. It&rsquo;s rather lonesome,
breaking into a new crowd by one&rsquo;s self.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It never occurred to Molly that she was being
paid undue honors. For a freshman, who had
arrived only the afternoon before, without a
friend in college, to be asked to a small intimate
party by the most prominent girl in the senior
class, was really quite remarkable, so Nance Oldham
thought; and she was pleased to be the one
Molly chose to take along.</p>

<p>The two girls had had a busy, exciting day.
They had not been placed in the same divisions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
B and O being so widely separated in the alphabet,
and were now meeting again for the first
time since lunch. Molly had stretched her length
on her couch and kicked off her pumps, described
later by Judy Kean as being a yard long and an
inch broad.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="molly1pl2" id="molly1pl2"></a>
<img src="images/molly1pl2.jpg" width="400" height="617" alt="&ldquo;I wish you would tell me your receipt for making friends,
Molly,&rdquo; exclaimed Nance.&mdash;Page&nbsp;51." title="" />
<br /><span class="caption">&ldquo;I wish you would tell me your receipt for making friends,
Molly,&rdquo; exclaimed Nance.&mdash;<i>Page&nbsp;51.</i></span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you would tell me your receipt for
making friends, Molly,&rdquo; exclaimed Nance. &ldquo;You
are really a perfect wonder. Don&rsquo;t you find it
troublesome to be so nice to so many people?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d find it lots harder not to be nice,&rdquo; answered
Molly. &ldquo;Besides, it&rsquo;s a rule that works
both ways. The nicer you are to people, the nicer
they are to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you think lots of people aren&rsquo;t
worth the effort and if you treat them like sisters,
they are apt to take advantage of it and
bore you afterwards?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been troubled that way,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t tell me,&rdquo; cried Nance, warming
to the argument, &ldquo;that that universally cordial
manner of yours doesn&rsquo;t bring a lot of rag-tags
around to monopolize you. If it hasn&rsquo;t before, it
will now. You&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You make me feel like the leader of Coxey&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Army,&rdquo; laughed Molly; &ldquo;because, you see, I&rsquo;m a
kind of a rag-tag myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her eyes filled with tears. She was thinking
of her meagre wardrobe. Nance was silent. She
was slow of speech, but when she once began,
she always said more than she intended simply
to prove her point; and now she was afraid she
had hurt Molly&rsquo;s feelings. She was provoked
with herself for her carelessness, and when she
was on bad terms with herself she appeared to be
on bad terms with everybody else. Of course, in
her heart of hearts, she had been thinking of
Frances Andrews, whom she felt certain Molly
would never snub sufficiently to keep her at a
distance.</p>

<p>The two girls went about their dressing without
saying another word. Nance was coiling her
smooth brown braids around her head, while
Molly was looking sorrowfully at her only two
available dresses for that evening&rsquo;s party. One
was a blue muslin of a heavenly color but considerably
darned, and the other was a marquisette,
also the worse for wear. Suddenly Nance
gave a reckless toss of her hair brush in one
direction and her comb in another, and rushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
over to Molly, who was gazing absently into the
closet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Molly,&rdquo; she cried impetuously, seizing her
friend&rsquo;s hand, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a brute. Will you forgive
me? I&rsquo;m afraid I hurt your feelings. It&rsquo;s just
my unfortunate way of getting excited and saying
too much. I never met any one I admired as
much as you in such a short time. I wish I did
know how to be charming to everybody, like you.
It&rsquo;s been ground into me since I was a child not
to make friends with people unless it was to my
advantage, and I found out they were entirely
worthy. And it&rsquo;s a slow process, I can tell you.
You are the very first chance acquaintance I ever
made in my life, and I like you better than any
girl I ever met. So there, will you say you have
forgiven me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, I will,&rdquo; exclaimed Molly, flushing
with pleasure. &ldquo;There is nothing to forgive. I
know I&rsquo;m too indiscriminate about making
friends. Mother often complained because I
would bring such queer children out to dinner
when I was a child. Indeed, I wasn&rsquo;t hurt a bit.
It was the word &lsquo;rag-tag,&rsquo; that seemed to be such
an excellent description of the clothes I must
wear this winter, unless some should drop down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
from heaven, like manna in the desert for the
Children of Israel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without a word, Nance pulled a box out from
under her couch and lifted the lid. It disclosed
a little hand sewing machine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you sew?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After a fashion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I can. It&rsquo;s pastime with me. I&rsquo;d rather
make clothes than do lots of other things. Now,
suppose we set to work and make some dresses.
How would you like a blue serge, with turn-over
collar and cuffs, like that one Miss Marks is
wearing, that fastens down the side with black
satin buttons?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Nance, I couldn&rsquo;t let you do all that for
me,&rdquo; protested Molly. &ldquo;Besides, I haven&rsquo;t the
material or anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you earn some money, Molly?&rdquo;
suggested Nance. &ldquo;There are lots of different
ways. Mrs. Murphy, the housekeeper, was telling
me about them. One of the girls here last
year actually blacked boots&mdash;but, of course, you
wouldn&rsquo;t do anything so menial as that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; interrupted Molly. &ldquo;Just watch
me. That&rsquo;s a splendid idea, Nance. It&rsquo;s a fine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
honorable labor, as Colonel Robert Wakefield
said, when his wife had to take in boarders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly slipped on the blue muslin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It really doesn&rsquo;t make any difference what
she wears,&rdquo; thought Nance, looking at her friend
with covert admiration. &ldquo;She&rsquo;d be a star in a
crazy quilt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two girls hurried down to supper. Molly
was thoughtful all through that conversational
meal. Her mind was busy with a scheme by
which she intended to remove that unceasing
pressure for funds which bade fair to be an ever-increasing
bugbear to her.</p>

<p>No. 16 on the Quadrangle turned out to be a
very luxurious and comfortable suite of rooms,
consisting of quite a large parlor, a little den
or study and a bedroom. Mary Stewart met
them at the door in such a plain dress that at
first Molly was deceived into thinking it was
just an ordinary frock until she noticed the lines.
And in a few moments Nance took occasion to
inform her that simplicity was one of the most
expensive things in the world, which few people
could afford, and furthermore that Mary Stewart&rsquo;s
gray, cottony-looking dress was a dream of
beauty and must have come from Paris.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>There were six or seven other girls in the
crowd, including that little bird-like, bright-eyed
creature they called &ldquo;Jennie Wren,&rdquo; whose real
name was Jane Wickham. The only other girl
they knew was Judith Blount, who had been so
snubby to Molly the day before about the luggage.</p>

<p>All these girls were musical, as the freshmen
were soon to learn, and belonged to the College
Glee Club.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a pretty room!&rdquo; exclaimed Molly to
her hostess, after she had been properly introduced
and enthroned in a big tapestry chair, in
which she unconsciously made a most delightful
and colorful picture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you like it. I have some trouble
keeping it from getting cluttered up with &lsquo;truck,&rsquo;
as we call it. It&rsquo;s about like Hercules trying to
clean the Augean Stables, I think, but I try and
use the den for an overflow, and only put the
things I&rsquo;m really fond of in here. That helps
some.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are certainly lovely,&rdquo; said the young
freshman, looking wistfully at the head of &ldquo;The
Unknown Woman,&rdquo; between two brass candlesticks
on the mantel shelf. On the bookshelves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
stood &ldquo;The Winged Victory,&rdquo; and hanging over
the shelves on the opposite side of the room was
an immense photograph of Botticelli&rsquo;s &ldquo;Primavera.&rdquo;
The only other pictures were two Japanese
prints and the only other furniture was
a baby grand piano and some chairs. It was
really a delightfully empty and beautiful place,
and Molly felt suddenly strangely crude and ignorant
when she recalled the things she had intended
to do to her part of the room at Queen&rsquo;s
Cottage toward beautifying it. She was engaged
in mentally clearing them all out, when a voice
at her elbow said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you thinking of taking the vows, Miss
Brown?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was Judith Blount, who had drawn up a
chair beside her&rsquo;s. There was something very
patronizing and superior in Miss Blount&rsquo;s manner,
but Molly was determined to ignore it, and
smiled sweetly into the black eyes of the haughty
sophomore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Taking what vows?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I understood you had become a cloistered
nun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly flushed. So the story was out. It didn&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
take long for news to travel through a girl&rsquo;s
college.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t cloistered very long,&rdquo; she answered.
&ldquo;And the only vow I took was never to be caught
there again after six o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you like Epiménides? I hear he&rsquo;s
made a great joke of it,&rdquo; she continued, without
waiting for Molly to answer. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s rather humorous,
you know. Even in his most serious
work, it will come out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there was much to joke about,&rdquo;
put in Molly, feeling a little indignant. &ldquo;I was
awfully forlorn and miserable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The real joke was that he called you &lsquo;little
Miss Smith,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Judith.</p>

<p>Molly&rsquo;s moods reflected themselves in her eyes
just as the passing clouds are mirrored in two
blue pools of water. A shadow passed over her
face now and her eyes grew darker, but she kept
very quiet, which was her way when her feelings
were hurt. Then Mary Stewart began to
play on the piano, and Molly forgot all about the
sharp-tongued sophomore, who, she strongly suspected,
was trying to be disagreeable, but for
what reason for the life of her Molly could not
see.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>Never before had she heard any really good
playing on the piano, and it seemed to her now
that the music actually flowed from Mary&rsquo;s
long, strong fingers, in a melodious and liquid
stream. Other music followed. Judith sang a
gypsy song, in a rich contralto voice, that Molly
thought was a little coarse. Jennie Wren, who
could sing exactly like a child, gave a solo in the
highest little piping soprano. Two girls played
on mandolins, and Mary Stewart, who appeared
to do most things, accompanied them on a guitar.
Then came supper, which was rather plain, Molly
thought, and consisted simply of tea and cookies.
&ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s artistic not to have much to eat,&rdquo;
her thoughts continued, but she made up her
mind to invite Mary Stewart to supper before
the old ham and the hickory nut cake were consumed
by hungry freshmen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems to me that with such a voice as yours
you must sing, Miss Brown,&rdquo; here broke in Mary
Stewart. &ldquo;Will you please oblige the company?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t like to sing after all this fine
music,&rdquo; protested Molly. &ldquo;Besides, I don&rsquo;t know
anything but darky songs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The very girl we want for our Hallowe&rsquo;en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Vaudeville,&rdquo; cried Jennie Wren. &ldquo;What do you
use, a guitar or a piano?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Either, a little,&rdquo; answered Molly, blushing
crimson; &ldquo;but I haven&rsquo;t any more voice than a
rabbit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fire away,&rdquo; cried Jennie Wren, thrusting a
guitar into her hands.</p>

<p>Molly was actually trembling with fright when
she found herself the center of interest in this
musical company.</p>

<br /><span class="caption">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m scared to death,&rdquo; she announced. Then she struck a

</div>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m scared to death,&rdquo; she announced, as she
faintly tuned the guitar. Then she struck a
chord and began:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;Ma baby loves shortnin&rsquo;,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ma baby loves shortnin&rsquo; bread;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Mammy&rsquo;s gwine make him some shortnin&rsquo;
bread.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Before she had finished, everybody in the room
had joined in. Then she sang:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;Ole Uncle Rat has come to town,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To buy his niece a weddin&rsquo; gown,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">OO-hoo!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;A quarter to ten,&rdquo; announced some one, and
the next moment they had all said good-night
and were running as fast as their feet could carry
them across the campus, &ldquo;scuttling in every direction
like a lot of rats,&rdquo; as Judith remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lights out at ten o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; whispered Nance
breathlessly, as they crept into their room and
undressed in the dark. It was very exciting.
They felt like a pair of happy criminals who had
just escaped the iron grasp of the law.</p>

<p>When Molly Brown dropped into a deep and
restful sleep that night, she never dreamed that
she had already become a noted person in college,
though how it happened, it would be impossible
to say. It might have been the Cloister
story, but, nevertheless, Molly&mdash;overgrown child
that she may have seemed to Professor Green&mdash;had
a personality that attracted attention wherever
she was.</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />

<small>THE KENTUCKY SPREAD.</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Molly, you look a little worried,&rdquo; observed
Nance Oldham, two days before the famous
spread was to take place, it having been set for
Friday evening.</p>

<p>Molly was seated on her bed, in the midst of
a conglomerate mass of books and clothes, chewing
the end of a pencil while she knitted her
brows over a list of names.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not exactly worried,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;But, you
know, Nance, giving a party is exactly like some
kind of strong stimulant with me. It goes to
my head, and I seem to get intoxicated on invitations.
Once I get started to inviting, I can&rsquo;t
seem to stop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Molly Brown,&rdquo; put in Nance severely, &ldquo;I believe
you&rsquo;ve just about invited the whole of Wellington
College to come here Friday night. And
because you are already such a famous person,
everybody has accepted.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I can about remember how many I
asked,&rdquo; she replied penitently. &ldquo;There are all
the girls in the house, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Frances Andrews?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And all the girls who were at Miss Stewart&rsquo;s
the other night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, even that girl who makes catty
speeches. That black-eyed Blount person?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, even so,&rdquo; continued Molly sadly. &ldquo;I
really hadn&rsquo;t intended to ask her, Nance, but I do
love to heap coals of fire on people&rsquo;s heads, and
besides, I just told you, when I get started, I
can&rsquo;t seem to stop. When I was younger, I&rsquo;ve
been known to bring home as many as six strange
little girls to dinner at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The next time you give a party,&rdquo; put in
Nance, &ldquo;we&rsquo;d better make out the list beforehand,
and then you must give me your word of
honor not to add one name to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to,&rdquo; replied Molly with contrition,
&ldquo;but it&rsquo;s awfully hard to take the pledge when
it comes to asking people to meals, even spreads.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two girls examined the list together, and
Molly racked her brains to try and remember
any left-outs, as she called them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m certain that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; she said at last. &ldquo;That
makes twenty, doesn&rsquo;t it? Oh, Nance, I tremble
for the old ham and the hickory nut cake. Do
you think they&rsquo;ll go round? Aunty, she&rsquo;s my
godmother, is sending me another box of beaten
biscuits. She has promised to keep me supplied.
You know, I have never eaten cold light bread
in my life at breakfast, and I&rsquo;d just as soon choke
down cold potatoes as the soggy bread they give
us here. But beaten biscuit and ham and home-made
pickles won&rsquo;t be enough, even with hickory
nut cake,&rdquo; she continued doubtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a chafing dish. We can make fudge;
then there&rsquo;s tea, you know. We can borrow cups
and saucers from the others. But we&rsquo;ll have to
do something else for their amusement besides
feed them. Have you thought of anything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lillie and Millie,&rdquo; these were two sophomores
at Queen&rsquo;s, &ldquo;have a stunt they have promised
to give. It&rsquo;s to be a surprise. And Jennie Wren
has promised to bring her guitar and oblige us
with a few selections, but, oh, Nance, except for
the eatin&rsquo;, I&rsquo;m afraid it won&rsquo;t be near such a
fine party as Mary Stewart&rsquo;s was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eatin&rsquo;s the main thing, child. Don&rsquo;t let that
worry you,&rdquo; replied Nance consolingly. &ldquo;I think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
I have an idea of something which would interest
the company, but I&rsquo;m not going to tell even
you what it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nance had a provoking way of keeping choice
secrets and then springing them when she was
entirely ready, and wild horses could not drag
them out of her before that propitious moment.</p>

<p>On Friday evening the girls began to arrive
early, for, as has been said, Molly was already
an object of interest at Wellington College, and
the fame of her beaten biscuits and old ham had
spread abroad. Some of the guests, like Mary
Stewart, came because they were greatly attracted
toward the young freshman; and others,
like Judith Blount, felt only an amused curiosity
in accepting the invitation. As a general
thing, Judith was a very exclusive person, but
she felt she could safely show her face where
Mary Stewart was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This looks pretty fine to me,&rdquo; observed that
nice, unaffected young woman herself, shaking
hands with Molly and Nance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good of you to say so,&rdquo; replied Molly.
&ldquo;Your premises would make two of our&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;m
thinking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, look at your grand buffet. How clever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
of you! One of you two children must have a
genius for arrangement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The study tables had been placed at one end
of the room close together, their crudities covered
with a white cloth borrowed from Mrs.
Murphy, and on these were piled the viands in a
manner to give the illusion of great profusion
and plenty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Molly,&rdquo; laughed Nance; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s a natural
entertainer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; put in Molly. &ldquo;I come of a family
of cooks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And did your cook relatives marry butlers?&rdquo;
asked Judith.</p>

<p>Molly stifled a laugh. Somehow Judith
couldn&rsquo;t say things like other girls. There was
always a tinge of spite in her speeches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where I come from,&rdquo; she said gravely, &ldquo;the
cooks and butlers are colored people, and the old
ones are almost like relatives, they are so loyal
and devoted. But there are not many of those
left now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The room was gradually filling, and presently
every guest had arrived, except Frances Andrews.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t wait for her,&rdquo; said Molly to Lillie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
and Millie, the two inseparable sophomores, who
now quietly slipped out. Presently, Nance, major
domo for the evening, shoved all the guests
back onto the divans and into the corners until
a circle was formed in the centre of the room.
She then hung a placard on the knob of the door
which read:</p>

<p class="placard">
MAHOMET, THE COCK OF THE EAST,<br />

<big><i>vs.</i></big><br />

CHANTECLER, THE COCK OF THE WEST.
</p>

<p>There was a sound of giggling and scuffling,
the door opened and two enormous, man-sized
cocks entered the room. Both fowls had white
bodies made by putting the feet through the
sleeves of a nightgown, which was drawn up
around the neck and over the arms, the fullness
gathered into the back and tied into a rakish
tail. A Persian kimono was draped over Mahomet
to represent wings and a tightly fitting
white cap with a point over the forehead covered
his head. His face was powdered to a
ghastly pallor with talcum and his mouth had
been painted with red finger-nail salve into a
cruel red slash across his countenance. Chantecler<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
was of a more engaging countenance. A
small red felt bedroom slipper formed his comb
and a red silk handkerchief covered his back
hair. The two cocks crowed and flapped their
wings and the fight began, amid much laughter
and cheering. Twice Chantecler was almost
spurred to death, but it was Mahomet&rsquo;s lot to
die that evening, and presently he expired with
a terrible groan, while the Cock of the West
placed his foot on Mahomet&rsquo;s chest and crowed
a mighty crow, for the West had conquered the
East.</p>

<p>That was really the great stunt of the evening,
and it occupied a good deal of time. Molly began
carving the ham, which she had refused to
do earlier, because a ham, properly served,
should appear first in all its splendid shapely
wholeness before being sliced into nothingness.
Therefore she now proceeded to cut off thin portions,
which crumbled into bits under the edge of
the carving knife borrowed from Mrs. Murphy.
But the young hostess composedly heaped it upon
the plates with pickle and biscuit, and it was
eaten so quickly that she had scarcely finished
the last serving before the plates were back
again for a second allowance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>During the hot fudge and hickory nut cake
course, the door opened and a Scotch laddie,
kilted and belted in the most approved manner
entered the room. His knees were bare, he
wore a little Scotch cap, a black velvet jacket
and a plaidie thrown over one shoulder. But
the most perfect part of his get-up was his miniature
bagpipe, which he blew on vigorously, and
presently he paused and sang a Scotch song.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nance!&rdquo; cried several of the Queen&rsquo;s Cottage
girls, for it was difficult to recognize the quiet
young girl from Vermont in this rakish disguise.</p>

<p>In the midst of the uproar there was a loud
knock on the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; called Molly, a little frightened,
thinking, perhaps, the kindly matron had for
once rebelled at the noise they were making.</p>

<p>Slowly the door opened and an old hag stepped
into the room. She was really a terrible object,
and some of the girls shrieked and fell back as
she advanced toward the jolly circle. Her nose
was of enormous length, and almost rested on
her chin, like a staff, like the nose of &ldquo;The Last
Leaf on the Tree.&rdquo; Also, she had a crooked
back and leaned heavily on a stick. On her head
was a high pointed witch&rsquo;s cap. She wore black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
goggles, and had only two front teeth. The
witch produced a pack of cards which she dexterously
shuffled with her black gloved hands.
Then she sat down on the floor, beckoning to the
girls to come nearer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Half-a-minute fortune for each one,&rdquo; she observed
in a muffled, disguised voice, but it was a
very fulsome minute, as Judy remarked afterward,
for what little she said was strictly to the
point.</p>

<p>To Judith Blount she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;English literature is your weak point. Look
out for danger ahead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This seemed simple enough advice, but Judith
flushed darkly, and several of the girls exchanged
glances. Molly, for some reason, recalled
what Judith had said about Professor Edwin
Green.</p>

<p>Many of the other girls came in for knocks,
but they were very skillful ones, deftly hidden under
the guise of advice. To Jennie Wren the
witch said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be careful of your friends. Don&rsquo;t ever cultivate
unprofitable people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To Nance Oldham she said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You will always be very popular&mdash;if you stick
to popular people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was all soon over. Molly&rsquo;s fortune had been
left to the last. The strange witch had gone so
quickly from one girl to another that they had
scarcely time to take a breath between each fortune.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As for you,&rdquo; she said at last, turning to
Molly, &ldquo;I can only say that &lsquo;kind hearts are more
than coronets, and simple faith than Norman
blood,&rsquo; and by the end of your freshman year
you will be the most popular girl in college.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; cried Molly, suddenly coming
out of her dream.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, who are you?&rdquo; cried Judith, breaking
through the circle and seizing the witch by the
arm.</p>

<p>With a swift movement the witch pushed her
back and she fell in a heap on some girls who
were still sitting on the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will know who you are,&rdquo; cried Jennie Wren,
with a determined note in her high voice, as she
grasped the witch by the arm, and it did look
for a moment as if the Kentucky spread were
going to end in a free-for-all fight, when suddenly,
in the midst of the scramble and cries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
came three raps on the door, and the voice of the
matron called:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Young ladies, ten o&rsquo;clock. Lights out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girls always declared that it was the witch
who had got near the door and pushed the button
which put out every light in the room. At
any rate, the place was in total darkness for half
a minute, and when Molly switched the lights on
again for the girls to find their wraps the witch
had disappeared.</p>

<p>In another instant the guests had vanished
into thin air and across the moonlit campus
ghostly figures could be seen flitting like shadows
over the turf toward the dormitories, for
there was no time to lose. At a quarter past ten
the gates into the Quadrangle would be securely
locked.</p>

<p>Nance lit a flat, thick candle, known in the
village as &ldquo;burglar&rsquo;s terror,&rdquo; and in this flickering
dim light the two girls undressed hastily.</p>

<p>Suddenly Molly exclaimed in a whisper:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nance, I believe it was Frances Andrews
who dressed up as that witch, and I&rsquo;m going to
find out, rules or no rules.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She slipped on her kimono and crept into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
hall. The house was very still, but she tapped
softly on Frances&rsquo; door. There was no answer,
and opening the door she tiptoed into the room.
A long ray of moonlight, filtering in through the
muslin curtains, made the room quite light.
There was a smell of lavender salts in the air,
and Mollie could plainly see Frances in her bed.
A white handkerchief was tied around her head,
as if she had a headache, but she seemed to be
asleep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Frances,&rdquo; called Molly softly.</p>

<p>Frances gave a stifled sob that was half a
groan and turned over on her side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Frances,&rdquo; called Molly again.</p>

<p>Frances opened her eyes and sat up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is anything the matter?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>Molly went up to the bedside. Even in the
moonlight she could see that Frances&rsquo; eyes were
swollen with crying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was afraid you were ill,&rdquo; whispered Molly.
&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you come to the spread?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had a bad headache. It&rsquo;s better now.
Good night.&rdquo; Molly crept off to her room.</p>

<p>Was it Frances, after all, who had broken up
her party?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>Molly was inclined to think it was not, and
yet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At any rate, we&rsquo;ll give her the benefit of the
doubt, Nance,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

<p>But there were no doubts in Nance&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />

<small>KNOTTY PROBLEMS.</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;I tell you things do hum in this college!&rdquo; exclaimed
Judy Kean, closing a book she had been
reading and tossing it onto the couch with a
sigh of deep content.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how you can tell anything about
it, Judy,&rdquo; said Nance severely. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been so
absorbed in &lsquo;The Broad Highway&rsquo; every spare
moment you&rsquo;ve had for the last two days that
you might as well have been in Kalamazoo as in
college.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nance, you do surely tell the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth,&rdquo; said Judy good
naturedly. &ldquo;I know I have the novel habit badly.
It&rsquo;s because I had no restraint put upon me in
my youth, and if I get a really good book like
this one, I just let duty slide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you put your talents to some use
and write, then?&rdquo; demanded Nance, who enjoyed
preaching to her friends.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Art is more to my taste,&rdquo; answered Judy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, art is long and time is fleeting. Why
don&rsquo;t you get busy and do something?&rdquo; exclaimed
the other vehemently. &ldquo;What do you
intend to be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy had a trick of raising her eyebrows and
frowning at the same time, which gave her a
serio-comic expression and invested her most
earnest speeches with a touch of humor. But
she did not reply to Nance&rsquo;s question, having
spent most of her life indulging her very excellent
taste without much thought for the future.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you intend to be?&rdquo; she asked presently
of Nance, who had her whole future
mapped out in blocks: four years at college, two
years studying languages in Europe, four years as
teacher in a good school, then as principal, perhaps,
and next as owner of a school of her own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I expect to teach languages,&rdquo; said
Nance without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, a teacher. I might have known!&rdquo;
cried Judy. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve commenced already on me&mdash;your
earliest pupil!</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0b">&ldquo;&lsquo;Teacher, teacher, why am I so happy, happy,
happy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In my Sunday school?&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>She broke off with her song suddenly and
seized Nance&rsquo;s hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t scold me, Nance, dear. I know
life isn&rsquo;t all play, and that college is a serious
business if one expects to take the whole four
years&rsquo; course. I&rsquo;ve already had a warning. It
came this morning. It&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve been cutting
classes. And I have been entirely miserable.
That&rsquo;s the reason I&rsquo;ve been so immersed in &lsquo;The
Broad Highway.&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve been trying to drown my
sorrows in romance. I know I&rsquo;m not clever&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; interrupted the other impatiently.
&ldquo;You are too clever, you silly child. That&rsquo;s what
is the matter with you, but you don&rsquo;t know how
to work. You have no system. What you really
need is a good tutor. You must learn to concentrate&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Concentrate,&rdquo; laughed Judy. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s something
I never could do. As soon as I try my
thoughts go skylarking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I sit very still and dig my toes into the
soles of my shoes and my finger nails into the
palms of my hands and say over and over the
thing I&rsquo;m trying to concentrate on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girls were still laughing joyously when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Molly came in. Her face wore an expression of
unwonted seriousness, and she was frowning
slightly. Three things had happened that morning
which worried her considerably.</p>

<p>The first shock came before breakfast when
she had looked in her handkerchief box where
she kept her funds promiscuously mixed up with
handkerchiefs and orris root sachet bags and
found one crumpled dollar bill and not a cent
more. There was a kind of blind spot in Molly&rsquo;s
brain where money was concerned, little of it as
she had possessed in her life. She never could
remember exactly how much she had on hand,
and change was a meaningless thing to her. And
now it was something of a blow to her to find
that one dollar must bridge over the month&rsquo;s expenses,
or she must write home for more, a thing
she did not wish to do, remembering the two
acres of apple orchard which had been sunk in
her education.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s all gone in silk attire and riotous
living,&rdquo; she said to herself, for she had bought
herself ten yards of a heavenly sky blue crêpey
material which she and Nance proposed to make
into a grand costume, also she had entertained
numbers of friends at various times to sundaes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
in the village. One of the other of her triple
worries was a note she had received that morning
from Judith Blount, and the third was another
note, about both of which she intended to
ask the advice of her two most intimate friends.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s bothering you, child?&rdquo; demanded
Judy, quick to notice any change in her adored
Molly&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, several things. These two notes for one.&rdquo;
She drew two envelopes from her pocket and
opening the first one, began to read aloud:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Miss Brown</span>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Since you come of a family of cooks and are
expert on the subject, I am going to ask you to
take charge of a little dinner I am giving to-morrow
night in my rooms to my brother and
some friends. I shall expect you to be chief cook,
but not bottle-washer. You&rsquo;ll have an assistant
for that; but I&rsquo;d like you to wait on the table,
seeing you are so good at those things. Don&rsquo;t
bother about cap and apron. I have them.</p>

<p><span class="rght2">&ldquo;&lsquo;Yours with thanks in advance,</span><br />
<span class="rght1">&ldquo;&lsquo;Judith Blount.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span><br />
</p></div>

<p>The note was written on heavy cream-colored
paper with two Greek letters embossed at the top
in dark blue. Judith lived in the Beta Phi House,
which was divided into apartments, and occupied
by eight decidedly well-to-do girls, the richest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
girls in college, as a matter of fact. It was called
&ldquo;The Millionaire&rsquo;s Club,&rdquo; and was known to be
the abode of snobbishness, although Molly, who
had been there once to a tea, had been entirely
unconscious of this spirit.</p>

<p>Judy and Nance were speechless with indignation
after Molly had finished reading the note.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think of that?&rdquo; she exclaimed,
breaking the silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a rank insult,&rdquo; cried Nance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you were a man, you could challenge her
to a duel,&rdquo; cried Judy; &ldquo;but being a girl, you&rsquo;ll
have to take it out in ignoring her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s written in such a matter-of-fact way,&rdquo;
continued Molly, &ldquo;that I can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s entirely
unusual. After sober, second thought, I believe
I&rsquo;ll ask Sallie before I answer it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speaking of angels&mdash;there is Sallie!&rdquo; cried
Judy, as that young woman herself hurried past
the door on her way to a class.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it? Make it quick. I&rsquo;m late now!&rdquo;
ejaculated Sallie, popping her head in at the door
with a smile on her face to counteract her abrupt
manner. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s in trouble now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The three freshmen stood silently about her
while she perused Judith&rsquo;s note.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever hear of such a thing?&rdquo; burst
out Judy with hot indignation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, lots of times, little one. It&rsquo;s quite
customary for freshmen to act as waitresses
when girls in the older classes entertain in their
rooms. The freshies like to do it because they
get such good food. I do think this note is
expressed, well&mdash;rather unfortunately. It has a
sort of between-the-lines superiority. But Judith
is always like that. You just have to take her as
you find her and ignore her faults. You&rsquo;d better
accept, Molly, with good grace. You&rsquo;ll enjoy
the food, too. To-morrow&mdash;let me see, that&rsquo;s
New England boiled dinner night, isn&rsquo;t it? You&rsquo;ll
probably have beefsteak and mushrooms and
grape fruit and ice cream and all the delicacies
of the season.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, if you advise it, I&rsquo;ll accept, like a
lady,&rdquo; said Molly resignedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s customary,&rdquo; answered Sallie, smiling
cheerfully and waving her hand as she hurried
down the hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s settled,&rdquo; continued Molly sighing.
Somehow, Judith Blount did get on her
nerves. &ldquo;Now, the other note is even more serious
in a way. Listen to this.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>Before reading it, she carefully closed the door,
drew the other girls into the far end of the room
and began in a low voice:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Miss Brown</span>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;May I have the pleasure of being your escort
to the sophomore-freshman ball? Let me know
whether you intend to wear one of your cerulean
shades. The carriage will stop for us at eight
o&rsquo;clock. You might leave the answer at my door
to-night.</p>

<p><span class="rght3">&ldquo;&lsquo;Yours faithfully,</span><br />
<span class="rght1">&ldquo;&lsquo;Frances Andrews.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span><br />
</p></div>

<p>The girls looked at each other in consternation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s to be done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say you have another engagement,&rdquo; advised
Judy, who was not averse at times to telling polite
fibs in order to extricate herself from a difficulty.
But Molly was the very soul of truth, and
even small fibs were not in her line.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t any one else asked you yet?&rdquo; asked
Nance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; you see, it&rsquo;s a week off, and I suppose
they are just beginning to think of partners
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All I can say is that if you do go with her
you are done for,&rdquo; announced Nance solemnly.</p>

<p>Molly sat down in the Morris chair and wrinkled
her brows.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I do wish she hadn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She just regards you as a sort of life preserver,&rdquo;
exclaimed Judy. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s trying to keep
above the surface by holding on to you. If I
were you, I wouldn&rsquo;t be bothered with her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, I know,&rdquo; said Molly, &ldquo;that Frances
Andrews did something last year that put her in
the black books with her class. She&rsquo;s trying to
live it down, and they are trying to freeze her
out. Nobody has anything to do with her, and
she&rsquo;s not invited to anything except the big entertainments
like this. I can&rsquo;t help feeling sorry
for her, and I don&rsquo;t see how it would do me any
harm to go with her. But I just don&rsquo;t want to
go, that&rsquo;s all. I&rsquo;d rather take a beating than
go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then you are a chump for considering
it!&rdquo; exclaimed Judy, whose self-indulgent nature
had little sympathy for people who would do uncomfortable
things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, on the other hand,&rdquo; continued Molly,
&ldquo;suppose my going would help her a little, don&rsquo;t
you think it would be mean to turn her down?
Oh, say you think I ought to do it, because I&rsquo;m
going to, hard as it seems.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nance went over and put her arms around her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
friend, quite an unusual demonstration with her,
while Judy seized her hand and patted it tenderly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, Molly, you are quite the nicest person
in the world,&rdquo; she exclaimed. Then she
added: &ldquo;By the way, Molly, can you spare the
time to tutor me for a month or so? I don&rsquo;t
know what the rates are, but we can settle about
that later. Nance tells me I must get busy or
else take my walking papers. I&rsquo;d be afraid of a
strange tutor. I&rsquo;m a timid creature. But I
think I might manage to learn a few things from
you, Molly, dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Did Judy understand the look of immense relief
which instantly appeared on Molly&rsquo;s sensitive
face? If she did she made no sign.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t say no,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;I know
you are awfully busy, and all that, but it would
be just an act of common charity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say no?&rdquo; cried Molly, laughing lightly. &ldquo;I
can hardly wait to say yes,&rdquo; and she cheerfully
got out six pairs of muddy boots from the closet,
enveloped herself in a large apron, slipped on a
pair of old gloves and went to work to clean and
black them. Molly had become official bootblack
at Queen&rsquo;s Cottage at ten cents a pair when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
were not muddy, and fifteen cents when they
were.</p>

<p>When she had completed her lowly job she sat
down at her desk and wrote two notes.</p>

<p>One was to Judith Blount, in which she accepted
her invitation to wait at table in the most
polite and correct terms, and signed her name
&ldquo;Mary Carmichael Washington Brown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The second letter, which was to Frances Andrews,
was also a note of acceptance.</p>

<p>Then Molly removed her collar, rolled up her
sleeves, kicked off her pumps&mdash;a signal that she
was going to begin work&mdash;and sat down to cram
mathematics,&mdash;the very hardest thing in life to
her and the subject which was to be a stumbling
block in her progress always.</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />

<small>AN INCIDENT OF THE COFFEE CUPS.</small></h2>


<p>Molly turned up at the Beta Phi House about
five o&rsquo;clock the next evening. She wore a blue
linen so that if any grease sputtered it would fall
harmlessly on wash goods, and in other ways attired
herself as much like a maid as possible with
white collar and cuffs and a very plain tight arrangement
of the hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m to be a servant, I might as well look
like one,&rdquo; she thought, as she marched upstairs
and rapped on Judith&rsquo;s door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; called the voice of Jennie Wren.
&ldquo;Judith&rsquo;s gone walking with her guests,&rdquo; she explained;
&ldquo;but she left her orders with me, and
I&rsquo;ll transmit them to you,&rdquo; she added rather
grandly. &ldquo;You are to do the cooking. Here are
all the things in the ice box, and there&rsquo;s the gas
stove on the trunk. Miss Brinton and I will set
the table.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly gathered that Caroline Brinton, the unbending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
young woman from Philadelphia, had
been chosen as her assistant.</p>

<p>The tiny ice box was stuffed full of provisions.
There was the inevitable beefsteak, as Sallie had
predicted; also canned soup; a head of celery,
olives, grape fruits, olive oil, mushrooms, cheese&mdash;really,
a bewildering display of food stuffs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did Miss Blount decide on the courses?&rdquo;
Molly asked Jennie Wren.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; she got the raw material and left the rest
entirely with you. &lsquo;Tell her to get up a good
dinner for six people,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care how
she does it, only she must have it promptly at
six-fifteen.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were only two holes to the gas stove and
likewise only two saucepans to fit over them, so
that it behooved Molly to look alive if she were
to prepare dinner for six in an hour and a
quarter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the can opener?&rdquo; she called.</p>

<p>A calm, experienced cook with the patience of
a saint might have felt some slight irritability if
she had been placed in Molly&rsquo;s shoes that evening.
Nothing could be found. There was no
can opener, no ice pick, the coffeepot had a limited
capacity of four cups, and there was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
broiler for the steak. It had to be cooked in a
pan. It must be confessed also that it was the
first time in her life Molly had ever cooked an
entire meal. She had only made what her
grandmother would have called &ldquo;covered dishes,&rdquo;
or surprise dishes, and she now found preparing
a dinner of four courses for six people rather a
bewildering task.</p>

<p>At last there came the sound of voices in the
next room. She put on the beefsteak. Her
cheeks were flaming from the heat of the little
stove. Her back ached from leaning over, and
her head ached with responsibility and excitement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is everything all right?&rdquo; demanded Judith,
blowing into the room with an air of &ldquo;if it isn&rsquo;t
it will be the worse for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe so,&rdquo; answered Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you put the anchovies on crackers?&rdquo;
demanded the older girl irritably. &ldquo;They should
have been on toast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because there wasn&rsquo;t enough bread for one
thing, and because there was no way to toast it
if there had been,&rdquo; answered Molly shortly.</p>

<p>No cook likes to be interfered with at that
crucial moment just before dinner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Here are your cap and apron,&rdquo; went on Judith.
&ldquo;You know how to wait, don&rsquo;t you? Always
hand things at the left side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Water happens to be poured from the right,&rdquo;
answered Molly, pinning on the little muslin cap.
She was in no mood to be dictated to by Judith
Blount or any other black-eyed vixen.</p>

<p>Judith made no answer. She seemed excited
and absent-minded.</p>

<p>Caroline placed the anchovies while Molly
poured the soup into cups, there being no plates.
The voices of the company floated in to her.
Jennie Wren had joined them, making the sixth.</p>

<p>She heard a man&rsquo;s voice exclaim:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, Ju-ju, I call this very luxurious. We
never had anything so fine as this at Harvard.
You always could hold up the parent and get
what you wanted. Now, I never had the nerve.
And, by the way, have you got a cook, too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only for to-night,&rdquo; answered Judith. &ldquo;We
usually eat downstairs with the others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re working some poor little freshman,
ten to one,&rdquo; answered Judith&rsquo;s brother, for that
was evidently who it was. Then Molly heard
some one run up a brilliant scale and strike a
chord and a good baritone voice began singing:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0b">&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m a cook and a captain bold,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And a mate of the Nancy brig,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a bo&rsquo;sun tight and a midshipmatemite,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the crew of the captain&rsquo;s gig.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you join in, Eddie? But I forgot.
It would never do for a Professor of English
Literature at a girls&rsquo; college to lift his voice in
ribald song.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some one laughed. Molly recognized the voice
instantly. She knew that Professor Edwin
Green was dining at Judith&rsquo;s that night, and her
inquiring mind reached out even further into the
realms of conjecture, and she guessed who was
the author of his light opera.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cousin Edwin, will you sit there, next to
me?&rdquo; said Judith&rsquo;s voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cousin?&rdquo; repeated Molly. &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s it, is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then other voices joined in&mdash;Mary Stewart,
Jennie Wren and Martha Schaeffer, a rich girl
from Chicago, who roomed in that house.</p>

<p>They gobbled down the first course as people
usually dispatch relishes, and as Caroline removed
the dishes, Molly appeared with the soup.
None of the girls recognized her, of course,
which was perfectly good college etiquette, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Mary Stewart smiled when Molly placed
her cup of soup and whispered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly gave her a grateful look, and Professor
Edwin Green, looking up, caught a glimpse of
Molly&rsquo;s flushed face, and smiled, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, Ju-ju, who&rsquo;s your head waitress?&rdquo;
Molly could not help overhearing Richard Blount
ask when she had left the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, just a little Southern girl named Smith,
or something,&rdquo; answered Judith carelessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That young lady,&rdquo; said Professor Edwin
Green, &ldquo;is Miss Molly Brown, of Kentucky.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young freshman&rsquo;s face was crimson when
she brought in the steak and placed it in front
of Mr. Blount.</p>

<p>Then she took her stand correctly behind his
chair, with a plate in her hand, waiting for him
to carve.</p>

<p>Sometimes two members of the same family are
so unlike that it is almost impossible to believe
that blood from the same stock runs in their
veins. So it was with Richard Blount and his
sister, Judith. She was tall and dark and arrogant,
and he was short and blond and full of
good-humored gayety. He rallied all the girls at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
the table. He teased his Cousin Edwin. He
teased his sister, and then he ended by highly
praising the food, looking all the time from one
corner of his mild blue eyes at Molly&rsquo;s flushed
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;a French chef must
have broiled this steak. Not even Delmonico,
nor Oscar himself at the Waldorf, could have
done it better. Isn&rsquo;t it the top-notch, Eddie?
What&rsquo;s this? Mushroom sauce? By Jupiter, it&rsquo;s
wonderful to come out here in the wilds and get
such food.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary Stewart began to laugh. After all, it
was just good-natured raillery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Mr. Blount,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;there is something
to be found here that is lots better than
porter-house steak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it? Name it, please!&rdquo; cried Richard.
&ldquo;If I must miss the train, I must have some, whatever
it is&mdash;cream puffs or chocolate fudge?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Kentucky ham of the finest, what do
you call it&mdash;breed? Three years old. You&rsquo;ve
never eaten ham until you&rsquo;ve tasted it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She smiled charmingly at Molly, who pretended
to look unconscious while she passed the vegetables.
Judith endeavored to change the subject.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>She was angry with Mary for thus bringing her
freshman waitress into prominence. But Molly
was destined to be the heroine of the evening in
spite of all efforts against it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Old Kentucky ham!&rdquo; cried Richard Blount,
starting from his chair with mock seriousness,
&ldquo;Where is it? I implore you to tell me. My soul
cries out for old ham from the dark and bloody
battleground of Kentucky!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Everybody began to laugh, and Judith exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do hush, Richard. You are so absurd! Did
he behave this way at Harvard all the time,
Cousin Edwin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; only more so. But tell me more of
this wonderful ham, Miss Stewart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly wondered if Professor Green really understood
that it was all a joke on her when he
asked that question.</p>

<p>Suddenly she formed a resolution. Following
her assistant into the next room, she whispered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which would you rather do, Miss Brinton?
Go over to Queen&rsquo;s and ask Nance to give you
the rest of my ham or wait on the table while I
go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather get the ham,&rdquo; replied Miss Brinton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
whose proud spirit was crushed by the menial
service she had been obliged to undertake that
evening.</p>

<p>The dinner progressed. In a little while Molly
had cleared the table and was preparing to bring
on the grape-fruit salad when Caroline appeared
with the remnants of the ham. Molly removed
it from its wrappings and, placing it on a dish,
bore it triumphantly into the next room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; cried Richard Blount. &ldquo;Do my
eyes deceive me? Am I dreaming? Is it possible&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The old ham, or, rather, the attenuated ghost
of the old ham!&rdquo; ejaculated Mary Stewart.</p>

<p>Even Judith joined in the burst of merriment,
and Professor Green&rsquo;s laugh was the gayest of
all.</p>

<p>Molly returned with the carving knife and
fork, and Richard Blount began to snip off small
pieces.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ham bone am very sweet,&rsquo;&rdquo; he sang, one
eye on Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is certainly wonderful,&rdquo; exclaimed Professor
Green, as he tasted the delicate meat; &ldquo;but it
seems like robbery to deprive the owner of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Edwin, you keep quiet, please,&rdquo; interrupted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Richard. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that some owners
of old hams are just as fond of things sweeter
than ham bones. A five-pound box ought to be
the equivalent of this, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, Richard, you go too far,&rdquo; put in Judith,
frowning at her brother.</p>

<p>But Richard took not the slightest notice of
her, nor did he pause until he had cleaned the ham
bone of every scrap of meat left on it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to catch your train?&rdquo; asked
Judith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think not to-night, Ju-ju,&rdquo; he answered, smiling
amiably. &ldquo;Edwin, can you put me up? If
not, I&rsquo;ll stop at the inn in the village.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed, you won&rsquo;t, Dick. You must stop
with me. I have an extra bed, solely in hopes
you might stay in it some night. And later this
evening we might run over&mdash;er&mdash;a few notes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked consciously at Richard, then he gave
Molly a swift, quizzical glance, remembering
probably that he had confided to her and her
alone that he was the author of the words of a
comic opera.</p>

<p>Having cleared the table, Molly now returned
with the coffee. The cups jaggled as she handed
them. She was very weary, and her arms ached.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
When she had reached Professor Edwin Green,
Richard Blount, with his nervous, quick manner,
suddenly started from his chair and exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, I know whom you remind me of&mdash;Ellen
Terry at sixteen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nobody but Molly realized for a moment that
he was talking to her, and she was so startled that
her wrist gave a twist and over went the tray
and three full coffee cups straight on to the knees
of the august Professor of English Literature.</p>

<p>There was a great deal of noise, Molly remembered.
She herself was so horrified and stunned
that she stood immovable, clutching the tray
wildly, as a drowning person clings to a life preserver.
She heard Judith cry:</p>

<p>&ldquo;How stupid! How could you have been so
unpardonably awkward!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the same moment Mary Stewart said:
&ldquo;It was entirely your fault, Mr. Blount. You
frightened the poor child with your wild behavior.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Professor Green said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t scold, Judith. I&rsquo;m to blame. I joggled
the tray with my elbow. There&rsquo;s no harm done,
at any rate. These gray trousers will be much
improved by being dyed <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cafe au lait</i>.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Richard Blount rose from the table and
marched straight over to where Molly was standing
transfixed, still miserably holding to the tray.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Brown,&rdquo; he said humbly, &ldquo;I want to
apologize. All this must have been very trying
for you, and you have behaved beautifully. I
hope you will forgive me. My only excuse is that
I am always forgetting my little sister and her
friends are not still children. Will you forgive
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked so manly and good-natured standing
there before her with his hand held out, that
Molly felt what slight indignation there was in
her heart melting away at once. She put her
hand in his.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is nothing to forgive, Mr. Blount,&rdquo; she
said, and the young man who was a musician
pricked up his ears when he heard that soft, musical
voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve robbed you of your ham,&rdquo; he continued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a pleasure to know you enjoyed it,&rdquo;
she said.</p>

<p>Presently Molly began clearing the table.
Richard sat down at the piano. It was evident
that he never wandered far from his beloved instrument,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
and the girls gathered around him
while he ran over the first act of his new opera.</p>

<p>Professor Edwin Green said good night and
took himself and his coffee-soaked trousers home
to his rooms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can follow later, Dickie,&rdquo; he called.</p>

<p>As he passed Molly, standing by the door, he
smiled at her again, and Molly smiled back,
though she was quite ready to cry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ham was delicious,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Thank you
very much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That night, when Molly had wearily climbed
the stairs to her room and flung herself on her
couch, Nance, writing at her desk, called over:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, how was the beefsteak?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t get any,&rdquo; said Molly. &ldquo;Even if there
had been any left, I was too tired to eat anything.
I&rsquo;m afraid I wasn&rsquo;t born to be anybody&rsquo;s cook,
Nance, or waitress, either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Molly turned her face to the wall and wept
silently.</p>

<p>Lest we forget, we will say now that two days
after this episode of the coffee cups, there came, by
express for Miss Molly Brown, a five-pound box of
candy without a card, and the girls at Queen&rsquo;s Cottage
feasted right royally for almost two evenings.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<small>CONCERNING CLUBS,&mdash;AND A TEA PARTY.</small></h2>


<p>At the first meeting of the freshman class of
19&mdash;, Margaret Wakefield of Washington, D.&nbsp;C.,
had been elected President.</p>

<p>Just how this came about no one could exactly
say. She could not have been accused of electioneering
for herself, and yet she made an impression
somehow and had won the election by a large
majority.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anybody who can talk like that ought to be
President of something,&rdquo; Molly had observed
good naturedly. &ldquo;She could make a real inauguration
speech, I believe, and she knows all
about Parliamentary Law, whatever that is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She dashed off the class constitution just as
easily as if she were writing a letter home,&rdquo; said
Judy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not so easy, either,&rdquo; added Nance
mournfully.</p>

<p>The girls were silent. It had gradually leaked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
out as their friendship progressed that Nance&rsquo;s
home was not an abode of happiness by any
means. And yet Nance had written a theme on
&ldquo;Home,&rdquo; which was so well done that she had
been highly complimented by Miss Pomeroy, who
had read it aloud to the class. Molly often wondered
just what manner of woman Nance&rsquo;s
mother was, and she soon had an opportunity of
finding out for herself.</p>

<p>But the conversation about the new class president
continued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;President Wakefield wants us to have bi-monthly
meetings,&rdquo; continued Judy. &ldquo;She wishes
to divide the class into committees and have a
chairman for each committee&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Committees for what?&rdquo; demanded Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear knows,&rdquo; laughed Judy, &ldquo;but her father&rsquo;s
a Congressman, and she has inherited his passion
for law and order, I suppose. She wants to conduct
a debate on Woman&rsquo;s Suffrage to meet Saturdays.
It&rsquo;s to be called &lsquo;The Woman&rsquo;s Franchise
Club,&rsquo; and she wishes to establish by-laws
and resolutions and a number of other things
that are Greek to me, for &lsquo;the political body corporate.&rsquo;
She says it&rsquo;s a crying shame that women
know so little about the constitution of their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
country, and in establishing a debating society,
she hopes to do some missionary work in that
line.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy had risen and was waving her arms dramatically
while her voice rose and fell like an
old-time orator&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose we ought,&rdquo; said Molly; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;d
rather put it off a year or so. There are so many
other things to enjoy first. Besides, it will be four
years before I reach the voting age, and by that
time I hope my &lsquo;intellects&rsquo; will have developed
sufficiently to take in the constitution of the country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyhow,&rdquo; exclaimed Judy, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud to have
a class president who&rsquo;s such a first-class public
speaker, because it takes it all off our shoulders.
Whenever there&rsquo;s a speech to be made or anything
public and embarrassing to be done, we&rsquo;ll
just vote for her to do it, because she will enjoy
it so much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But are you going to join the debating club?&rdquo;
asked Nance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s our duty to,&rdquo; replied Molly;
&ldquo;but I do hate to pin myself down. Suppose we
say we&rsquo;ll go to one and listen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;d better settle it now, because here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
comes the President sailing up the walk. She&rsquo;s
going the rounds now, I suppose, and in another
two minutes she&rsquo;ll be springing the question on
us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy, who was sitting at the front window of
her own room, nodded down into the yard and
smiled politely, and the girls had just time to
settle among themselves what they were going to
say when there was a smart rap on the door and
President Wakefield entered.</p>

<p>She wore rather masculine-looking clothes, and
carried a business-like small-sized suit case in
one hand and a notebook in the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, girls!&rdquo; she began; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad I
caught you together. It saves telling over the
same thing three times. I want to know first exactly
how you stand on the woman&rsquo;s suffrage
question. Now, don&rsquo;t be afraid to be frank
about it, and speak your minds. Of course, I&rsquo;m
sure that, being women who are seeking the
higher education, you are all of you on the right
side&mdash;the side of the thinking woman of to-day&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here Judy sneezed so violently that she almost
upset the little three-legged clover-leaf tea table
at her elbow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you feel on the subject, Molly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly smiled broadly, while Nance cleared her
throat and Judy blew her nose and exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I must be taking cold. Excuse me
while I get a sweater,&rdquo; and disappeared in the
closet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t know very much about
the subject, Margaret. You see, I was brought
up in the country, and I haven&rsquo;t had a chance to
go into woman&rsquo;s suffrage very deeply.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no time like the present for beginning,
then,&rdquo; said Margaret promptly, opening the
business-like little suit case. &ldquo;Read these two
pamphlets and you&rsquo;ll get the gist of the entire
subject clearly and concisely expressed. I will
call on you for an opinion next week after you&rsquo;ve
had time to study the question a bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly took the pamphlets and began hastily
turning the leaves. She wanted to laugh, but
she felt certain it would offend Margaret deeply
not to be taken seriously, and she controlled her
facial muscles with an effort while she waited for
attack No. Two.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nance, have you taken any interest in this
question?&rdquo; continued Margaret, who seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
have the patience of a fanatic spreading his belief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know something about it,&rdquo; replied Nance
quietly. &ldquo;You see, my mother is President of a
Woman&rsquo;s Suffrage Association, and she spends
most of her time going about the country making
speeches for the National Association.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, is your mother Mrs. Anna Oldham, the
famous clubwoman?&rdquo; cried Margaret.</p>

<p>Nance nodded her head silently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, she is one of the greatest authorities on
women&rsquo;s suffrage in the country!&rdquo; exclaimed
Margaret with great enthusiasm. &ldquo;It says so
here. Look, it gives a little sketch of her life
and titles. She is president of two big societies
and an officer in five others. It&rsquo;s all in this little
book called &lsquo;Famous Club Women in America
and England.&rsquo; Dear me,&rdquo; continued Margaret
modestly, &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;d better resign and give the
chair to you, Nance. I&rsquo;m nobody to be preaching
to you when you must know the subject from
beginning to end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nance smiled in her curious, whimsical way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you ever eaten too much of something,
Margaret,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and then hated it ever afterward?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; replied the President, &ldquo;that has
happened to every one, I suppose. Mince pie and
I have been strangers to each other for many
years on that account.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued Nance, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been fed on
clubs until I feel like a Strausberg goose. I&rsquo;ve
had them crammed down my throat since I was
five years old. When I was twelve, I was my
mother&rsquo;s secretary, and I&rsquo;ve sent off thousands of
just such pamphlets as you are distributing now.
I learned to write on the typewriter so I could
copy my mother&rsquo;s speeches. I&rsquo;ve been usher at
club conventions and page at committee meetings.
I&rsquo;ve distributed hundreds of badges with
&lsquo;Votes for Women&rsquo; printed on them. I had to
make a hundred copies of mother&rsquo;s speech on &lsquo;The
Constitution and By-Laws of the United States,&rsquo;
and send them to a hundred different women&rsquo;s
clubs. So, you see,&rdquo; she added, simply, frowning
to keep back her tears, &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll take a rest
from clubs while I&rsquo;m at college and begin to enjoy
life a little with Molly and Judy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Margaret Wakefield, who was really a very
nice girl and exceedingly well-bred, leaned over
and placed a firm, rather large hand on Nance&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think you had had enough,&rdquo; she exclaimed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
giving the hand a warm squeeze. Seeing
teardrops glistening in Nance&rsquo;s eyes, she rose
and started to the door. &ldquo;If ever you do want to
come to any of the meetings, you will be very
welcome, girls,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but you don&rsquo;t want to
overdo anything in life, you know, and if there
are things that interest you more than Woman&rsquo;s
Suffrage you oughtn&rsquo;t to sacrifice yourselves.
People should follow their own bent, I think.
Good-bye,&rdquo; she went on, smiling brightly, &ldquo;and
don&rsquo;t bother to read the pamphlets, Molly, dear, if
you don&rsquo;t want to. It&rsquo;s a poor way to carry a
point to make a bugbear of the subject.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She went out quietly and closed the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I call her a perfect lady,&rdquo; exclaimed Molly,
trying not to look at Nance, but wishing at the
same time that her friend would give way just
once and have a good cry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s cut study this afternoon and take a
walk,&rdquo; exclaimed Judy. &ldquo;Trot along and get on
your sweaters. It&rsquo;s much too glorious to stay indoors.
Nance, can&rsquo;t you do your theme after
supper? Molly, you look a little peaked. It will
do you good to breathe the fresh, untainted air of
the pine woods.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>Judy, it must be confessed, was always glad
of a good excuse to get away from her books.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Splendid!&rdquo; cried Molly with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll bring my English tea basket,&rdquo; went
on Judy. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s got any cookies?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; said Nance, now fully recovered.</p>

<p>In five minutes the three girls had started
across the campus to the road and presently were
making for the pine woods that bordered the
pretty lake. Everybody seemed to be out roaming
the country that beautiful autumn afternoon.
Parties of girls came swinging past, who had
been on long tramps through the woods and over
to the distant hills which formed a blue and misty
background to the lovely rolling country. The
lake was dotted with canoes and rowboats, and
from far down the road that wound its way
through the valley there came the sound of singing.
Presently a wagon-load of girls emerged
into view, followed by another wagon filled with
autumn leaves and evergreens.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the sophomore committee on decoration,&rdquo;
Judy explained. Apparently she knew everything
that happened at college. &ldquo;They are getting the
decorations for the gym. for the ball to-morrow
night.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>Molly quickly changed the subject. She had
had two invitations to go to the Sophomore-Freshman
Ball since she had accepted Frances
Andrews&rsquo; offer, and several of the sophomores
had been to see her to ask her to change her mind,
but, having given her word, Molly intended to
keep it, no matter what was to pay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to the upper end of the lake,&rdquo; she
suggested. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s wilder and much prettier,&rdquo; and
she led the way briskly along the path through the
pine woods.</p>

<p>In a little while they came out at the other end
of the small body of water where the woods
abruptly ended at the foot of a hill called &ldquo;Round
Head,&rdquo; which the girls proceeded to climb. From
this eminence could be seen a widespreading
panorama of hills and valleys, little streams and
bits of forests, and beyond the pine woods the
college itself, its campus spread at its feet like
a mat of emerald green.</p>

<p>The girls paused breathlessly and Judy put
down her tea basket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s where a little refreshment might be
very welcome,&rdquo; she said, opening her basket of
which she was justly proud, for not many girls at
Wellington could boast of such a possession. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
filled the little kettle from the bottle of water she
had taken the precaution to bring along, and they
sat down in a circle on the turf. The autumn had
been a dry one, and the ground was not damp.
Nibbling cookies and sweet chocolate, they waited
for the water to boil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look, here comes some one,&rdquo; whispered Judy,
indicating the figure of a man appearing around
the side of the hill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do hope it&rsquo;s not a tramp,&rdquo; exclaimed Nance
uneasily.</p>

<p>Molly Brown hoped so, too, although she said
nothing. But she felt nervous, as who wouldn&rsquo;t
in that lonely place? As the man came nearer, it
became plain that he was making straight for
them, and he did most assuredly look like a wanderer
of some kind. He was dressed in an old
suit of rough gray, wore an old felt hat and
carried a staff like a pilgrim. The girls sat quite
still and said nothing. There had been a silent
understanding among them that it was better not
to run. As the man drew nearer, Molly became
suddenly conscious of the fact that across the
gray trousers just above the knees was a deep
coffee-colored stain.</p>

<p>The next moment the man stood before them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
leaning on his staff, his hat under his arm. It
was &ldquo;Epiménides Antinous Green.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Confess now,&rdquo; he said, smiling at all of them
and looking at Molly, whom he knew best of the
three, &ldquo;you took me for a tramp?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not exactly for a tramp,&rdquo; answered Molly;
&ldquo;but for one who tramps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the difference, Miss Brown?&rdquo; he asked
laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, everything. Clothes&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she paused,
blushing deeply. Her eyes had fallen on the coffee
stain. &ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t he have it cleaned off?&rdquo;
she thought, frowning slightly. &ldquo;And&mdash;and
looks,&rdquo; she continued out loud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even in the walk,&rdquo; Judy finished. &ldquo;Perhaps
we can give you a cup of tea, Professor,&rdquo; she
added politely.</p>

<p>The Professor was only too glad for a cup of
tea. He had been roaming the hills all day, he
said, and he was tired and thirsty. While he
sipped the fragrant beverage, he glanced at his
watch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The truth is, I had an appointment at this
spot at four-thirty,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;I was to
meet my young brother George, familiarly known
as &lsquo;Dodo.&rsquo; He&rsquo;s at Exmoor College, ten miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
over, and was to walk across the valley to the
rendezvous, and I was to conduct him safely to
my rooms for supper. He was afraid to enter
the college by the front gate for fear of meeting
several hundreds of young women. He runs like
a scared rabbit if he sees a girl a block off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t it give him an awful shock when he
catches a glimpse of us waiting here on the hilltop?&rdquo;
asked Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shock that won&rsquo;t hurt him,&rdquo; replied the
professor. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see what happens, at any rate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He put his cup and saucer on the ground, while
his quizzical eyes, which seemed to laugh even
when his face was serious, turned toward Molly.
And Molly was well worth looking at that afternoon,
although she herself was much dissatisfied
with her appearance. Her auburn hair had almost
slipped down her back. Her blue linen shirtwaist
was decidedly blousey at the waist line. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
because I haven&rsquo;t enough shape to keep it down,&rdquo;
she was wont to complain. Her cheeks were
glowing and her eyes as calmly blue as the summer
skies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we&rsquo;d better start on,&rdquo; said Nance uneasily.
She always felt an inexplicable shyness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
in the presence of men, and her friends had been
known to nickname her &ldquo;old maid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But before Professor Green could protest that
he was only too glad to have his bashful brother
make the acquaintance of three charming college
girls, Judy, ever on the alert, exclaimed,
&ldquo;Look, there he comes around the side of the
hill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Professor rose and signaled with his hat,
chuckling to himself, as he watched his youthful
brother pause irresolutely on the hillside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, Dodo,&rdquo; he shouted, making a trumpet
of his hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe not this afternoon, thank you,&rdquo; Dodo
trumpeted back. &ldquo;I have an important engagement
at six.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girls could not keep from laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame to frighten the poor soul like
that,&rdquo; exclaimed Molly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll start back, Professor,
and leave him in peace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the Professor was a man of determination,
and had made up his mind to bring his shy
brother into the presence of ladies that afternoon,
very attractive ladies at that, of George&rsquo;s own
age, with simple, unaffected manners, calculated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
to make a shy young man forget for the moment
that he had an affliction of agonizing diffidence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;George,&rdquo; called the professor, running a little
way down the hillside, &ldquo;come back and don&rsquo;t
be a fool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wretched lad turned his scarlet face in
their direction and began to climb the hill. He
was a tall, overgrown youth, with large hands
and feet, and when he stood in their midst, holding
his cap nervously in both hands, while the
Professor performed the introductions, he looked
like a soldier facing the battle.</p>

<p>It remained for Molly and Judy to put him at
his ease, however, with tea and cookies and questions
about Exmoor College, while the Professor
conversed with Nance about life at Wellington,
and which study she liked best. At last the spirit
of George emerged from its shy retreat, and he
forgot to feel self-conscious or afraid. They rose,
packed the tea things and started back. And it
was the Professor who carried Judy&rsquo;s tea basket,
while George, glancing from Molly&rsquo;s blue eyes to
Judy&rsquo;s soft gray ones, strolled between them and
related a thrilling tale of college hazing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was a swift remedy, was it not, Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Oldham?&rdquo; observed the Professor, laughing under
his breath.</p>

<p>But undoubtedly the cure was complete, for
that very evening Molly received a note, written
in a crabbed boyish hand, and signed &ldquo;George
Green,&rdquo; inviting the three girls to ride over to
Exmoor on the trolley the following Saturday and
spend the day. Miss Green, an older sister, would
act as chaperone.</p>

<p>And not a few thrills did these young ladies
experience at the prospect.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />

<small>RUMORS AND MYSTERIES.</small></h2>


<p>How many warm-hearted, impetuous people get
themselves into holes because of those two qualities
which are very closely allied indeed; and
Molly Brown was one of those people. Carried
away by emotions of generosity, she found herself
constantly going farther than she realized at
the moment. Why, for instance, could she not
have put Frances Andrews off with an excuse for
a day or so? Some one would surely have asked
her to the Sophomore-Freshman ball.</p>

<p>And if she had only liked Frances, matters
would have been different. If it had been an act
of friendship, of deep devotion. But in spite of
herself, she could not bring herself to trust that
strange girl, beautiful and clever as she undoubtedly
was, and sorry as Molly was for her. After
all, it was rather selfish of Frances to have obtained
the promise from Molly. Did she think it
would reinstate her in the affections of her class<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
to be seen in the company of the popular young
freshman?</p>

<p>All this time, Molly said nothing to her
friends, but on the morning of the ball she could
not conceal from Judy and Nance her apprehension
and general depression. And seeing their
friend&rsquo;s lack-lustre eye and drooping countenance,
they held a counsel of war in Judy&rsquo;s small bedroom.</p>

<p>At the end of this whispered conference, Judy
was heard to remark:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid of the girl, to tell you the truth.
Her fiery eyes and her two-pronged tongue seem
to take all the spirit out of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid of her,&rdquo; said Nance, who had
a two-pronged tongue of her own, once she was
stirred into action. &ldquo;You wait here for me, and
when I come back, you can go and notify the
sophomores of what&rsquo;s happened. Of course,
Molly will get to the ball all right. The thing is
to extricate her from the situation by the most
tactful and surest means.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;the thing is not to let
Molly know we have saved her life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Frances hadn&rsquo;t done that witch&rsquo;s stunt and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
said all those malicious things at Molly&rsquo;s Kentucky
spread, I don&rsquo;t think I should have minded
so much. And do you know, Judy, that the report
has spread abroad that she and Molly had
prepared the whole thing beforehand, speeches
and all and were in league together? You see,
Molly was the only one who wasn&rsquo;t hit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean it,&rdquo; cried Judy. &ldquo;Then, more
than ever, I want to spare the child the humiliation
she might have to suffer if she went with
Frances to-night. Go forth to battle, Nance, and
may the saints preserve you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nance girded her sweater about her like a coat
of mail, stiffened her backbone, pressed her lips
together and marched out to the fray. She never
told even Judy exactly what took place between
Frances and her in that small room, with its bewildering
array of fine trappings, silver combs
and brushes, yellow silk curtains at the window,
Turkish rugs, books and pictures. No one had
ever seen the room except Molly the night of the
spread, when it was too dark to make out what
was in it.</p>

<p>There was no loud talking. Whatever was
said was of the tense quiet kind, and presently
Nance emerged unscathed from the encounter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;She made me give my word of honor not to
tell what was said,&rdquo; she announced to the palpitating
Judy, &ldquo;but she&rsquo;s writing the note to Molly
now; so go quickly and inform someone that
Molly has no escort for the ball.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy departed much mystified and Nance remained
discreetly away from her own room until
she perceived Frances steal down the hall, push
a note under their door and then hurry back,
bang her own door and lock it.</p>

<p>Then, after a moment&rsquo;s grace, Nance marched
boldly to their chamber. Molly was reading the
note.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think, Nance?&rdquo; she exclaimed
with a tone of evident relief in her voice,
&ldquo;Frances Andrews can&rsquo;t go to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, and what reason does she give?&rdquo;
asked Nance, feeling very much like a conspirator
now that she was obliged to face Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;None. She simply says &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I can&rsquo;t
go to-night. Hope you&rsquo;ll enjoy it. F.&nbsp;A.&rsquo; How
does she expect me to get there, I wonder, at the
eleventh hour?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nance examined her finger nails attentively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps she&rsquo;s seen to that,&rdquo; she replied after
a pause.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Nance,&rdquo; said Molly, presently, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so relieved
that I think I&rsquo;ll have to &rsquo;fess up. It&rsquo;s mean
of me, I know, and I feel awfully ungenerous to
be so glad. You see, nobody can ever tell what
strange, freakish thing she&rsquo;s going to do. Of
course she was the witch. I knew it from the
conscious look that came into her face when I
told her about it afterwards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The mistake she has made is being defiant
instead of repentant,&rdquo; said Nance. &ldquo;Instead of
trying to brazen it out, she ought to &lsquo;walk softly,&rsquo;
as the Bible says, and keep quiet. She is the
most embittered soul I ever met in all my life.
If hatred counted for much, her hatred for her
own class would burn it to a cinder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a sound of hurrying footsteps on
the stairs and Judy burst into the room. Her face
was aflame and she flung herself into a chair
panting for breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your hurry?&rdquo; asked Molly, slipping
on her jacket. &ldquo;Excuse me, I must be chasing
along to French. Tell her the news, Nance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No need to tell Judy news, who had news of
her own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you, Nance,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;there are
times when I think the position of a freshman is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
one of the lowliest things in life. The first
sophomore I met was Judith Blount. I did feel
a little timid, but I told her what had happened.
&lsquo;You can tell your friend,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;that we
sophomores are not so gullible as all that, and if
her nerve has failed her at the last moment, it&rsquo;s
her fault, not ours.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Judy,&rdquo; exclaimed Nance, &ldquo;you didn&rsquo;t
know you were jumping from the frying pan
right into the fire when you told that to Judith
Blount, who has never liked Molly from the beginning.
It&rsquo;s jealousy, pure and simple, I think;
although there almost seems to be something
more behind it sometimes. She takes such pains
to be disagreeable. Was anyone else there to
hear you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. She was surrounded by her satellites,
Jennie Wren and a few others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two girls sat in gloomy silence for a few
minutes. After that rebuff, they hardly cared to
circulate the bit of news any further in the sophomore
class, which, it must be confessed, had the
reputation of being run by a clique of the most
arrogant and snobbish set of girls Wellington
College had ever known.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go and tell our woes to nice old Sally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
Marks,&rdquo; suggested Judy, and off they marched in
search of the good-natured funny Sally, whose
room was on the floor below.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; she called at their tap on the door,
and noticing at once their serious faces, she exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I declare, I am beginning to feel like the
Oracle at Delphi. What&rsquo;s the trouble, now, my
children?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ought never to have gone to Judith
Blount,&rdquo; she continued after they had unburdened
their secrets. But having gone to her, &ldquo;it
would be well,&rdquo; so spake the Oracle, &ldquo;to sit back
and hold tight. The news is certain to spread,
and of course only Judith and her ring would believe
that Molly sent you out to find her an escort.
There is one thing sure: Molly is obliged
to go to the dance, not only because she has so
many friends, but because she figures, I am told,
so largely in &lsquo;Jokes &amp; Croaks,&rsquo; and it would be
sport spoiled if she wasn&rsquo;t there when the things
are read out. Now, trot along, children, I&rsquo;m
cramming for an exam., and I&rsquo;m busier than the
busiest person in Wellington to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The afternoon dragged itself slowly along.
Nance took her best dress out of its wrappings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
heated a little iron and smoothed out its wrinkles.
She lifted Molly&rsquo;s blue crepe from its hanger and
laid it on the couch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was made in the simplest possible way out
of the least possible goods in the least possible
time,&rdquo; she informed Judy, who had wickedly cut
a class and sat moping in her friend&rsquo;s room.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it pretty? We made it together, and I&rsquo;m
really quite puffed up about the result. It&rsquo;s Empire,
you know,&rdquo; she added proudly.</p>

<p>The dress did indeed show the short Empire
waist. The round neck was cut out and finished
with a frill of creamy lace which Molly happened
to have, and there had not been much of a struggle
with the sleeves, which came only to the
elbow and were to all intents and purposes shapeless.
But the color was the thing, as Molly had
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be willing to drown in a color like that,&rdquo;
Judy observed. Judy was quite a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">poseuse</i> about
colors and assured her friends that she could
never wear red because it inflamed her temper
and made her cross; that violet quieted her
nerves; green stirred her ambitions, and blue
aroused her sympathies. While they were looking
at the dress, Margaret Wakefield and Jessie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Lynch, her roommate and boon companion, after
rapping on the door, sailed into the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We came to consult about clothes,&rdquo; they announced.
&ldquo;Is this to be an evening dress affair,
or what&rsquo;s proper to wear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The best you have,&rdquo; replied Judy, &ldquo;at least
that&rsquo;s what I was told by the oracular Sally below
stairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the love of heaven, don&rsquo;t tell that to
Jessie,&rdquo; cried Margaret. &ldquo;If you give her so
much rope, she&rsquo;ll be wearing purple velvet and
cloth of gold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jessie laughed good-naturedly. She was already
considered the best dressed and prettiest
girl in the freshman class, and it was a joke at
Queen&rsquo;s Cottage that she had been obliged to
apply to the matron for more closet room, because
the large one she shared with Margaret
Wakefield was not nearly adequate for her
numerous frocks. It had been a constant wonder
to the other girls in the house that these two
opposite types could have become such intimate
friends; but friends they were, and continued to
be throughout their college course, although
Jessie never could rake up an interest in the
U.&nbsp;S. Constitution or woman&rsquo;s suffrage, either.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>The two girls really formed a sort of combination
of brains and beauty, and it became generally
known that Jessie would hardly have pulled
through the four years, except for the indefatigable
efforts of her faithful friend, Margaret.</p>

<p>Mabel Hinton, a Queen&rsquo;s Cottage freshman,
now popped her head in at the door, which was
half open. She was a very odd character, but
she was popular with her friends, who called her
&ldquo;The Martian,&rdquo; probably because she had a phenomenal
intellect and wore enormous glasses in
tortoise shell frames which made her eyes look
like a pair of full moons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought I heard a racket,&rdquo; she said in her
crisp, catchy voice. &ldquo;I suppose you are all discussing
the news.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;News? What news?&rdquo; they demanded.</p>

<p>She closed the door carefully and came farther
into the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gather around me, girls,&rdquo; she said mysteriously,
enjoying their curiosity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what is it, Mabel? Don&rsquo;t keep us in suspense,&rdquo;
cried Judy, always impatient.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there is evidence that someone was
going to set fire to the gym. to-night,&rdquo; she began,
in a whisper. &ldquo;This morning a bundle of oil-soaked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
rags was discovered in a closet, and then
they began to search and found several other
bundles like the first. There was a lot of excitement,
and the Prex came over. They tried
to keep it quiet, but the story leaked out, of
course, and is still leaking&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she smiled.</p>

<p>The girls exchanged horrified glances. What
terrible disaster might not have befallen them if
the rags had not been discovered?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course it was the work of an insane person,&rdquo;
said Margaret Wakefield.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, but who? Is she one of the students
or some outside person?&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a common instinct, Judy and Nance
looked up at the same moment. Their glances
met. Without making a sound, Judy&rsquo;s lips formed
the word &ldquo;Frances.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the dance to take place, then?&rdquo; asked Jessie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. It&rsquo;s all been hushed up and things
will go on just as usual. I&rsquo;m going to look on
from the balcony. I shan&rsquo;t mingle with the
dancers, because they knock off my spectacles and
generally upset my equilibrium.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The door opened and Molly appeared in their
midst like a gracefully angular wraith, for her
face looked white, her shoulders drooped and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
long slim arms hung down at her sides dejectedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Molly, dear, has anything happened to
you?&rdquo; cried Nance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t say that nothing has happened,&rdquo;
answered Molly, sinking into a chair and resting
her chin on her hand. &ldquo;I have been put through
an ordeal this day, why, I can never tell you, but
I am glad you are all here so that I can tell you
about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They pressed about her, full of sympathy and
friendliness, while Judy, who loved comfort and
recognized the needs of the flesh under the most
trying circumstances, lit Nance&rsquo;s alcohol lamp
and put on the kettle to make tea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what is it?&rdquo; they all demanded, seeing
that Molly had fallen into a silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been with the President for the last
hour,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;though for what reason I can&rsquo;t
explain. I can&rsquo;t imagine why I was sent for and
brought to her private office. She was very nice
and kind. She asked me a lot of questions about
myself and all of Queen&rsquo;s girls. I was glad
enough to answer them, because we have nothing
to be ashamed of, have we, girls?&rdquo; Molly rose
and stood before them, spreading out her hands
with a kind of deprecating gesture. The circle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
of faces before her almost seemed abashed under
the steady gaze of her clear blue eyes. &ldquo;It was
a pleasure to tell her what nice girls were stopping
at Queen&rsquo;s Cottage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did she mention?&rdquo; began Judy and pointed to
the dividing wall of the next room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I was coming to that. But what do
I know about&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Mollie stopped short and
caught her breath. Her eyes turned towards the
door, which was opened softly. There stood
Frances Andrews.</p>

<p>She had evidently just come in, for she still
wore her sweater and tam o&rsquo; shanter, and brought
with her the smell of the fresh piney air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right about your escort for to-night,
Miss Brown. You are to go with Miss Stewart,
who has got special privilege from the sophomore
president to take you. Good-bye. I hope you&rsquo;ll
have a ripping time. I shan&rsquo;t see you at supper.
I&rsquo;m going off on the 6.15 train and won&rsquo;t be back
until Sunday night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was such a tense feeling in the circle of
freshmen as Frances stood there, that, as Judy
remarked afterwards, they almost crackled with
electricity.</p>

<p>It was quite late, and as most of the girls intended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
to dress for the party before supper, they
took their departure immediately without any
comment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is anything special the matter?&rdquo; asked Molly,
after they had gone and she was left alone with
her friends.</p>

<p>They told her the strange story which Mabel
Hinton had reported to them a little while before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that is the work of a lunatic,&rdquo; exclaimed
Molly, horrified.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I suppose,&rdquo; went on Nance, &ldquo;that the reason
Prexy sent for you was that she suspected
a certain person, who shall be nameless, and she
was told that you were the only person who had
ever been nice to her, and furthermore that you
were going to the dance with her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course that must be the reason,&rdquo; said
Molly, &ldquo;and of course it&rsquo;s absurd, I mean suspecting
Frances Andrews. She might be accused of
many things, but she is certainly in her right
mind. She&rsquo;s much cleverer than lots of the girls
in her class.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clever, yes. But should you call her balanced?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly did not answer. She felt anxious and
frightened, and a rap on the door at that moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
made her jump with nervousness. It proved to
be one of the maids of the house with two boxes
of flowers, both for Molly. One was pink roses
and contained the card of Mary Stewart, and the
other was violets, and contained no card whatever.</p>

<p>She divided the violets in half and made her
two friends wear them that night to the dance.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />

<small>JOKES AND CROAKS.</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning to feel that we shall issue happily
out of all our troubles,&rdquo; cried Judy Kean,
bursting into her friends&rsquo; room without knocking,
&ldquo;and the reason why I feel that way is because
when I am clothed in silk attire my soul
is clothed in joy. Especially when there&rsquo;s dancing
to follow. Button me up, someone, please, so
that I may take a good look at my resplendent
form in your mirror. I can&rsquo;t see more than a
square inch of neck in my own two by four.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girls stood back to admire their friend,
who indulged her artistic fancy in rather theatrical
clothes much too old for her, but who usually
succeeded in gaining the effect she sought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me, &lsquo;she walks in beauty like the night,&rsquo;&rdquo;
said Molly laughing. &ldquo;You look like a charming
and very youthful widow-lady, Judy, but how
comes it you are wearing black?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Black is for certain types,&rdquo; replied Judy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
sagely, &ldquo;and I am one of them. Next to black my
bilious skin takes on a dazzling, creamy tint and
my mouse-colored hair assumes a yellow glint
that is not its own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girls laughed at their erratic friend, who
was, indeed, dressed in black chiffon, from the
fluffy folds of which her vivacious young face
glowed like a flower.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you object to me, wait until you see Jessie,&rdquo;
cried Judy. &ldquo;She might be going to the opera,
she is so fine. She is wearing pink satin that
glistens all over like a Christmas tree with little
shiny things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Nance, whose well balanced
and correct tastes in most things rarely
failed her, was the most suitably dressed of our
girls, in her pretty white lingerie frock.</p>

<p>At eight o&rsquo;clock that evening Molly rolled away
luxuriously in a village hack with Mary Stewart,
holding her roses tenderly and carefully under her
gray eiderdown cape, so as not to crush them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully glad I was so lucky as to draw
you this evening, Molly,&rdquo; the older girl was saying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the lucky one,&rdquo; answered Molly, her
thoughts reverting to the strange discovery of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the morning. &ldquo;Oh, Miss Stewart, what did
Frances Andrews do last year to get herself into
such a mess and be frozen out by all her class this
year?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you perhaps some day, but not to-night.
We want to enjoy ourselves to-night.
Can you guide, Molly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like a streak. I always guided at home at
the school dances, because I was the tallest girl
in my class.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a guider, too,&rdquo; laughed Mary, &ldquo;and when
two guiders come together, I imagine it&rsquo;s a good
deal like a tug of war.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During the ride over to the gymnasium, neither
of the girls mentioned the thing uppermost in
their minds: the attempt to set the gymnasium on
fire that night. Nor was the rumor referred to
by anyone at the dance later. It was a strictly
forbidden topic, the President herself having issued
orders.</p>

<p>The great room was a mass of foliage and
bunting, Japanese lanterns and incandescent
lights in many colors, and it was really quite a
brilliant affair according to Molly&rsquo;s notions, who
had never seen anything but small country dances
usually given at the schoolhouse several miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
from her home. Lovely music floated from behind
a screen of palms and lovely girls floated on
the floor in couples, to the strains of the latest
waltz.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m going to be an awful wallflower,&rdquo;
thought Molly, feeling suddenly overgrown
and awkward in the midst of this swirling
mass of grace and beauty. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help feeling
queer and I don&rsquo;t seem to recognize anybody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Molly had plenty of partners that evening,
and after that first delightful waltz, it was nearly
an hour before she caught a glimpse of Mary
Stewart again in the crowd of dancers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it jolly?&rdquo; called Judy, as they dashed past
each other in a romping barn dance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never thought I could have such a good time
at a manless party,&rdquo; Jessie Lynch confided to
Molly while they rested against the wall later.
&ldquo;But, really, it&rsquo;s quite as good fun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; replied Molly. &ldquo;I think I never
had a better time in my life. But I&rsquo;m afraid our
roommates and friends are not enjoying it very
much,&rdquo; she added ruefully, pointing to the gallery,
where seated in a silent bored row were
Margaret Wakefield, Nance Oldham and Mabel
Hinton.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Jessie, &ldquo;you would never expect
Mabel to join this mad throng, but I&rsquo;m
surprised at Nance and Margaret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Margaret prefers conversation parties, I suppose,
and Nance is not fond of dancing, either.
She would always rather look on, she says.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two girls were standing near the musicians
and from the other side of the screen of palms
they now heard a voice say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you danced with the fantastic Empress
Josephine as yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not as yet,&rdquo; came the answer with a laugh.
&ldquo;But be careful, she is near&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly moved away hastily, her face crimson.</p>

<p>Jessie had heard the question also and recognized
the voice of Judith Blount.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Molly,&rdquo; she exclaimed, glancing at her
face, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t think they meant&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Molly, trying to smile naturally,
&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She glanced down at her home-made dress.
Perhaps it did look amateurish. She and Nance
had worked very hard over it, but, after all, they
were not experienced dressmakers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you look perfectly charming,&rdquo; went on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Jessie generously. &ldquo;The color is exactly right
for you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, color,&rdquo; answered Molly, &ldquo;but there ought
to be something besides color to a dress, you
know. Never mind, I shouldn&rsquo;t be such a sensitive
plant, Jessie. One ought not to mind being
called fantastic. It&rsquo;s not nearly so bad as being
called&mdash;well, malicious&mdash;cruel. I&rsquo;d rather be fantastic
than any of those things. But I did think
the dress was pretty when we made it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come along, and let&rsquo;s get some lemonade,
Molly. Your dress is sweet and suits you exactly,
so there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then someone came up and claimed Jessie for
the next dance, but Molly was grateful to the
pretty butterfly creature for her assurances and
she resolved to forget all about her dress. As she
lingered in the corner, uncertain whether to stay
where she was or join her friends in the gallery,
Mary Stewart made her way through the crowd
and called:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, here you are. Some of the seniors are
just outside and want to meet you. Will you
come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think I would,&rdquo; replied Molly, joyfully.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
Fantastic, or not, she had one good friend
among the older girls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is Miss Molly Brown of Kentucky,&rdquo; announced
Mary Stewart presently to a dozen august
seniors who shook her hand and began asking
her questions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had two reasons for wanting to meet you,
Miss Brown,&rdquo; here put in a very handsome big
girl, who spoke in an authoritative tone, which
made everybody stop and listen. (She was, in
fact, the President of the senior class.) &ldquo;One
of course was just to make your acquaintance,
and the other was to ask if you would do us a
favor. We are going to have a living picture
show Friday week for the benefit of the Students&rsquo;
Fund, and we wondered if you would pose in one
of the pictures, maybe several, we haven&rsquo;t decided
on them yet. But that dress must be in
one of them, don&rsquo;t you think so, Mary? One of
Romney&rsquo;s Lady Hamilton pictures for instance,
with a white gauze fichu; or a Sir Thomas Lawrence
portrait&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s too fantastic?&rdquo; asked
Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, that lovely blue thing? Heavens, no!
it&rsquo;s charming&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>Molly had barely time to thank her and accept
the invitation, when she and Mary were dragged
off to make up the big circle of &ldquo;right and left
all around,&rdquo; which wound up the dance. After
this whirling romp, three loud raps were heard
and gradually the noise of talking and laughter
subsided into absolute silence. A girl had
mounted the platform. She carried a megaphone
in one hand and a book in the other. She was the
official reader of her class, and now proceeded to
recite through the megaphone all the best and
most amusing material from &ldquo;Jokes &amp; Croaks.&rdquo;
According to time honored custom, the jokes were
greeted with applause and laughter, and the
croaks with groans and laughter, and anybody
who groaned at a joke or applauded a croak, if
she happened to be caught, was publicly humiliated
by being made to stand up and face the jeers
of the multitude. The girls finally decided, after
many ludicrous mistakes, that the jokes were on
the sophomores and the croaks were on the freshmen.
For instance, here was a croak:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;A lady of notable luck,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who cared not for turkey or duck,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Cried, &lsquo;Give me old ham<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
<span class="i2">And I don&rsquo;t give a slam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If it comes from Vermont or Kaintuck.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This was greeted with laughing groans, and
Molly for the first time realized the significance
of her roommate&rsquo;s name.</p>

<p>Margaret Wakefield figured in several croaks,
as &ldquo;the Suffragette of Queen&rsquo;s.&rdquo; In fact Queen&rsquo;s
girls came in for a good many croaks and began
to wait fearfully for what was to come next. But
the witticisms were all quite good-natured, even
the last, which called forth so many merry groans
that they soon ceased to be groans at all and became
uproarious laughter, and Molly, very red
and laughing, too, was the centre of all eyes.
This was the croak:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;They have locked me in the Cloisters,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They have fastened up the gate!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, let me out; Oh, let me out.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It&rsquo;s getting very late.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&rsquo;Tis said the ghosts of classes gone<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Do wander here at night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, let me out; Oh, let me out,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Before I die of fright!<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And then there rang a clarion voice.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It&rsquo;s tone was loud and clear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Oh, dry your eyes and cease your cries,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For help, I ween, is near.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But promise me one little thing<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Before I ope the gate:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, never pass the coffee tray,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If I am sitting nigh;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, if you pass the coffee tray,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Oh, then, just pass me by!&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>It was all very jolly and delightful, and for the
first time the girls felt that they were really a
part of the college life.</p>

<p>Mary Stewart was very sweet to Molly when
she took her home that night, and the young
freshman never realized until long afterwards,
when she was a senior herself, what a nice thing
her friend had done; for sophomore-freshman
receptions were an old story to Mary Stewart.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />

<small>EXMOOR COLLEGE.</small></h2>


<p>Busy days followed the sophomore-freshman
ball. The girls were &ldquo;getting into line,&rdquo; as Judy
variously expressed it; &ldquo;showing their mettle;
and putting on steam for the winter&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;
The story of the incendiary had been reported
exaggerated and had gradually died out altogether.
Frances Andrews had returned to college,
more brazenly facetious than ever, breaking
into conversations, loudly interrupting, making
jokes which no one laughed at except Molly and
Judy out of charity. She was a strange girl and
led a lonely life, but she was too much like the
crater of a sleeping volcano, which might shoot
off unexpectedly at any moment, and most of the
girls gave her a wide berth.</p>

<p>The weather grew cold and crisp. There was
a smell of smoke in the air from burning leaves
and from the chimneys of the faculty homes
wherein wood fires glowed cheerfully.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>At last Saturday arrived. It was the day of
the excursion to Exmoor, and it was with more
or less anxiety regarding the weather that the
three girls scanned the skies that morning for
signs of rain. But the heavens were a deep and
cloudless blue and the air mildly caressing,
neither too cold nor too warm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is like the Indian summers we have at
home,&rdquo; exclaimed Molly, when, an hour later,
they turned their faces toward the village through
which the trolley passed.</p>

<p>Mabel Hinton, passing them as they started,
had called out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Art off on a picnic?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And they had answered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We art.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some other girls had cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whither away so early, Oh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And they had cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Exmoor! To Exmoor, for now the day
has come at last!&rdquo; paraphrasing a song Judy was
in the habit of singing.</p>

<p>Indeed the day seemed so perfect and joyous
that they could hardly keep from singing aloud
instead of just humming when they boarded the
trolley car.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>Through the country they sped swiftly. The
valley unfolded itself before them in all its beauty
and the misty blue hills in the distance seemed
to draw nearer. Over everything there was a
sense of autumn peace which comes when the
world is drowsing off into his deep sleep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exmoor!&rdquo; called the conductor at last, and the
three girls stepped off at a charming rustic station.
With a clang of the bell which rang out
harshly in the still air, the car flew on.</p>

<p>The three girls looked at the empty station.
Then they looked at each other with a kind of
mock consternation, for nothing really mattered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is Dodo?&rdquo; asked Judy, with the smile
of the victor, since she had predicted only a few
moments before that Dodo might by this time
have become so frightened at his boldness that
he would suddenly become extinct like his namesake,
the dodo-bird.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if Dodo is really extinct,&rdquo; said Molly,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll just take a little walk back through the
fields. Epiménides thought nothing of it. He
expects to walk to-day and meet us at lunch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Dodo was not extinct that morning, and
they beheld him now running down the steep road
as fast as his heavy boots could carry him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Behold, his spirit has risen from its fossil remains
and he now walks among us in the guise
of a man,&rdquo; chanted Judy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make us laugh, Judy, just as the poor
soul arrives without enough breath to apologize,&rdquo;
said Nance, and the next instant the embarrassed
young man stood before them blushing and stammering
as if he had been caught in the act of
picking a pocket or committing some other slight
crime which required explanation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m terribly sorry&mdash;have you waited long?&mdash;the
schedule was changed&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t know&mdash;you
should have come half an hour later&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
mean that&mdash;I mean I wasn&rsquo;t ready&mdash;&rdquo; he broke
off in an agony of embarrassment and the girls
burst out laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you be caring,&rdquo; said Judy. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
here and nothing else really matters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have thought the station of a man&rsquo;s
college could be so deserted,&rdquo; observed Molly,
looking about the empty place.</p>

<p>Dodo assured her that plenty of people would
be there in half an hour, when the train arrived;
just then everybody was either in the village on
the other side of the buildings, or down on the
football grounds watching the morning practice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
game. There was to be a real game that afternoon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, it&rsquo;s only a small college,&rdquo; he went on.
&ldquo;There are only two hundred and fifty in all.
The standards are so high it&rsquo;s rather hard to get
in, but we are heavily endowed and can afford to
keep up the standards,&rdquo; he added proudly.</p>

<p>They climbed the road to the college almost in
silence and in ten minutes emerged on a level elevation
or table land which commanded a view of
the entire countryside. Here stood the college
buildings, built of red brick, seasoned and mellowed
with time. They were a beautiful and dignified
group of buildings, and there was a decidedly
old world atmosphere about the place and
the campus with splendid elm trees. Molly had
once heard Judith Blount refer to Exmoor as that
&ldquo;one-horse, old-fashioned little college,&rdquo; and she
was not prepared for anything so fine and impressive
as this.</p>

<p>Nor was she prepared for the surprise of Miss
Green, sister of Professor Edwin and Dodo. The
girls had pictured her a middle-aged spinster,
having heard she was older than the Professor
himself, who seemed a thousand to them. And
here, waiting for them, in the living room of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
Chapter House, was a very charming and girlish
young woman with Edwin&rsquo;s brown eyes and cleft
chin and George&rsquo;s blonde hair; the ease and
graciousness of one brother and the youthful fairness
of the other. She had come down from New
York the night before especially to meet them,
she said.</p>

<p>Rather an expensive trip, they thought, for one
day&rsquo;s pleasure, since it took about seven hours
and meant usually one meal and of course at
night a berth on the sleeper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At first I thought I couldn&rsquo;t manage it for this
week,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;but Edwin was so insistent
and no one has ever been known to refuse him
anything he really wanted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edwin! But why Edwin? Why not the youthful
and blushing Dodo? So Molly wondered,
while they were conducted over the entire college;
the beautiful little Gothic chapel with its stained
glass windows; through the splendid old library
which was much smaller than the one at Wellington,
but much more &ldquo;atmospheric&rdquo; as Judy had
remarked; then through the dormitories where
they remained discreetly in the corridors, and
finally back to the Chapter House, in which
George lodged with some thirty schoolmates.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>There on the piazza was Professor Edwin
Green waiting for them. He had made an early
start, he said, and walked the whole distance in
less than three hours. Some other young men
came up and were introduced, and the entire gay
party, Nance shyly sticking closely beside Miss
Green, went off to view the village, which was a
quaint old place well worth visiting, they were
told.</p>

<p>The train had evidently come in, and crowds
of people were hurrying up the road. There was
a sound of a horn and a coach dashed in sight
filled with students wearing crimson streamers in
their buttonholes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a crowd of Repton fellows come over to
see their team licked,&rdquo; George explained, &ldquo;but
look, Edwin, here comes Dickie Blount. I thought
he was in Chicago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Evidently he isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the Professor, his
eyes smiling, his mouth serious. It was Richard
Blount, the hero of the ham bone, and he straightway
attached himself to Molly and declined to
leave her side for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me that that delightful, joking, jolly
person is brother to Judith,&rdquo; whispered Judy in
Molly&rsquo;s ear.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>Molly nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no family resemblance, but it&rsquo;s true,
nevertheless.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Motor cars and carriages of all varieties now
began to arrive. The whole countryside had
turned out to see the great game between the
two local college teams, and the Wellington girls
pinned green rosettes in their buttonholes to signify
that their sympathies were all for Exmoor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the most exciting, jolliest time I ever had
in all my life,&rdquo; cried Molly to Professor Green,
who walked on her other side. &ldquo;And to think I
have never seen a football game before in all my
life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must draw a diagram for you and show you
what some of the plays are, or you will be in a
muddle,&rdquo; said the Professor, looking at her
gravely, almost, as Molly thought, as if she were
one of his English Literature pupils.</p>

<p>At lunch, according to the etiquette of the
place, George and his guests were placed at the
senior table. There was no smoking nor loud
talking and the students behaved themselves most
decorously, although George confided to Judy
that ordinarily pandemonium prevailed.</p>

<p>After lunch they started for the grounds in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
triumphal procession; for our Wellington freshmen
and their chaperone had an escort of at least
four or five young men apiece. Nance looked bewildered
and shy and happy; Judy was never
more sparkling nor prettier, and Molly was in
her gayest, brightest humor.</p>

<p>They had hardly left the Chapter House behind
them and proceeded in a snake-like procession
across the campus, when a black and prancing,
though rather bony, steed dashed up bearing
a young lady in a faultlessly fitting riding
habit. It was Judith Blount.</p>

<p>Nobody looked particularly thrilled at Judith&rsquo;s
appearance, not even Judith&rsquo;s brother, and Judy
almost exclaimed out loud:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bother! Why couldn&rsquo;t she stay at home just
once?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Cousin Grace?&rdquo; called Judith
from her perch. &ldquo;I heard you were going to be
down and I couldn&rsquo;t resist riding over to see you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are you, Judith? I&rsquo;m so glad to see
you,&rdquo; answered Cousin Grace in a tone without
much heart to it. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you come sooner?
We&rsquo;ve just finished lunch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks, I had a sandwich early. I suppose
you are off for the grounds. Go ahead. I&rsquo;ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
get Cousin Edwin to help me tie up this old animal
somewhere. We&rsquo;ll follow right behind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly was almost certain that Cousin Edwin
was about to place this office on the shoulders of
his younger brother, but glancing again at the
flushed and happy face of Dodo at the side of
Judy, the Professor relented and dropped behind
to look after his relation.</p>

<p>Never had Molly been so wildly excited as she
was over the football game that afternoon. It
was a wonderful picture, the two teams lined up
against each other; crowds of people yelling
themselves hoarse; the battle cry of the Repton
team mingling with the warlike cry of the Exmoor
students. The cheer leaders at the heads
of the cheer sections made the welkin ring continuously.
At last a young man, who seemed to
be a giant in size and strength, dashed like a
wild horse across the Russian steppes straight
up the field with the ball under his arm, and
from the insane behavior of the green men, including
Professor Edwin Green and his fair sister,
Molly became suddenly aware that the game
was over and Exmoor had won.</p>

<p>The cheering section could yell no more, because
to a man it had lost its voice; but, oh, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
glad burst of song from the Exmoor students
as they leaped into the field and bore the conquering
giant around on their shoulders. And,
oh! the dejection of the men of crimson as they
stalked sadly from the scene of their humiliation.</p>

<p>At last the whole glorious day was over and
the girls found themselves on the way to the
trolley station. Richard Blount and his cousin,
Miss Green, had hastened on ahead. They were
to take the six o&rsquo;clock train back to New
York.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cousin Edwin, why can&rsquo;t you hire a horse in
the village and ride back to Wellington with
me?&rdquo; asked Judith, when they paused at the
Chapter House for her to mount her black steed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m engaged to take these young
ladies home by trolley, Judith,&rdquo; answered the
Professor firmly.</p>

<p>Judith leaped on her horse without assistance,
gave the poor animal a savage lash with her
whip and dashed across the campus without another
word.</p>

<p>The ride back at sunset was even more perfect
than the morning trip. The Professor of English
Literature appeared to have been temporarily
changed into a boy. He told them funny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
stories and bits of his own college experiences,
and made them talk, too. Almost before they
knew it, the conductor was calling: &ldquo;Wellington!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />

<small>SUNDAY MORNING BREAKFAST.</small></h2>


<p>It was quite the custom at Wellington for
girls to prepare breakfasts on Sunday morning
in their rooms. There was always the useful
boneless chicken to be creamed in one&rsquo;s chafing
dish; and in another, eggs to be scrambled with
a lick and a promise, at these impromptu affairs;
and it was a change from the usual codfish balls
of the Sunday house breakfast.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="molly1pl4" id="molly1pl4"></a>
<img src="images/molly1pl4.jpg" width="400" height="617" alt="&ldquo;It was quite the custom for girls to prepare breakfast in
their rooms.&mdash;Page&nbsp;152." title="" />
<br /><span class="caption">It was quite the custom for girls to prepare breakfast in
their rooms.&mdash;<i>Page&nbsp;152.</i></span>
</div>

<p>On this particular Sunday morning, Judy was
very busy; for the breakfast party was of her
giving, in Molly&rsquo;s and Nance&rsquo;s room; her own
&ldquo;singleton&rdquo; being too small. She was also very
angry in her tempestuous and unrestrained way,
and having emptied the vials of her wrath on
Molly&rsquo;s head, she was angrier with herself for
giving away to temper.</p>

<p>Although it was Judy&rsquo;s party, Molly, as
usual kind-hearted and grandly hospitable, had
invited Frances Andrews. Then she had gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
and confessed her sins to Judy, who flared up
and said things she hadn&rsquo;t intended, and Molly
had wept a little and owned that she was entirely
at fault. But what could be done? Frances was
invited and had accepted. To atone for her sins,
poor Molly had made popovers as a surprise and
arranged to bake them in Mrs. Murphy&rsquo;s oven.
But the hostess being gloomy, the company was
gloomy, since the one is apt to reflect the humor
of the other. However, as the coffee began to
send forth its cheerful aroma from Judy&rsquo;s Russian
samovar, discord took wings and harmony
reigned. It was a very comfortable and sociable
party. Most of the girls wore their kimonos,
it being a time for rest and relaxation; but when
Frances Andrews swept into the room in a long
lavender silk <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">peignoir</i> trimmed with frills of
lace, all cotton crepe Japanese dressing gowns
faded into insignificance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no doubt that college girls are a
hungry lot,&rdquo; remarked Margaret Wakefield, settling
herself comfortably to dispose of food and
conversation and arouse argument, a thing she
deeply enjoyed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So much brain work requires nourishment,&rdquo;
observed Mabel Hinton.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;There is not much brain nourishment at
Queen&rsquo;s,&rdquo; put in Frances Andrews. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
living on raw eggs and sweet chocolate for the
last week. The table has run down frightfully.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sallie Marks was a loyal Queen&rsquo;s girl, and resented
this slur on the table of the establishment
which was sheltering her now for the third year.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The food here is quite as good as it is at any
of the other houses,&rdquo; she said coldly to the unfortunate
Frances, who really had not intended
to give offence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, but I don&rsquo;t agree with you,&rdquo; replied
Frances, &ldquo;and I have a right to my own
opinion, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy gave Molly a triumphant glance, as much
as to say, &ldquo;You see what you have done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Everybody looked a little uncomfortable, and
Margaret Wakefield, equal to every occasion,
launched into a learned discussion on how many
ounces of food the normal person requires a day.</p>

<p>Once more the talk flowed on smoothly. But
where Frances was, it would seem there were
always hidden reefs which wrecked every subject,
no matter how innocent, the moment it was
launched.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Molly, I can trade compliments with you,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
put in Jessie Lynch, taking not the slightest notice
of her roommate&rsquo;s discourse. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of
those very indirect, three-times-removed compliments,
but you&rsquo;ll be amused by it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really,&rdquo; said Molly, &ldquo;do tell me what it is before
I burst with curiosity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said &lsquo;trade,&rsquo;&rdquo; laughed Jessie, who liked a
compliment herself extremely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course,&rdquo; replied Molly. &ldquo;I have any
number I can give you in exchange. How do
you care for this one? Mary Stewart thinks
you are very attractive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does she, really? That&rsquo;s nice of her,&rdquo; exclaimed
Jessie, blushing with pleasure as if she
hadn&rsquo;t been told the same thing dozens of times
before. &ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s fine; not exactly pretty,
you know, but fine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you don&rsquo;t know how her father
made his money?&rdquo; broke in Frances.</p>

<p>There was a silence, and Molly, feeling that
she was about to be mortified again by something
disagreeable, cried hastily:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, I forgot the surprise. Do wait a
moment,&rdquo; and dashed from the room.</p>

<p>While she was gone, Nance and Judy began
filling up the intervals with odd bits of conversation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
helped out by the other girls, and Frances
Andrews did not have another opportunity to
put in her oar. Suddenly she rose and swept to
the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would none of you feel interested to
know, I suppose, that Mary Stewart&rsquo;s father
started life as a bootblack&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m starting life as,&rdquo; cried
Molly, who now appeared carrying a large tray
covered with a napkin. &ldquo;I am the official bootblack
of Queen&rsquo;s, and I make sometimes one-fifty
a week at it. I hope I&rsquo;ll do as well as Mr.
Stewart in the business. Have a popover?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She unfolded the napkin and behold a pile of
golden muffins steaming hot. There were wild
cries of joy from the kimonoed company.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, Jessie, I&rsquo;ll take my second-hand,
roundabout compliment&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she began, when
Judy interrupted her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you have a popover, Miss Andrews?&rdquo;
she asked in a cold, exasperated tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks; I eat the European breakfast usually&mdash;coffee
and roll&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve been there,&rdquo; answered Judy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say good morning. I&rsquo;ve enjoyed your little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
party immensely,&rdquo; and Frances marched out
of the room and banged the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think you would have learned a lesson
by this time, Molly Brown,&rdquo; cried Judy hotly.
&ldquo;There is always a row whenever that girl is
around. She can&rsquo;t be nice, and there is no use
trying to make her over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; said Molly penitently. &ldquo;I wish I
could understand why she behaves that way
when she knows it&rsquo;s going to take away what
few friends she has.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I can tell you,&rdquo; put in Mabel Hinton.
&ldquo;Nobody likes her, and nobody expects any good
of her. If you are constantly on the lookout for
bad traits, they are sure to appear. It&rsquo;s almost
a natural law. Everybody was expecting this
to-day, and so it happened, of course. If we had
been cordial and sweet to her, she never would
have said that about Mary Stewart or the food
at Queen&rsquo;s, either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me, are we listening to a sermon,&rdquo;
broke in Judy flippantly.</p>

<p>But, in spite of Judy&rsquo;s interruption, Mabel&rsquo;s
speech made an impression on the girls, some of
whom felt a little ashamed of their attitude toward
Frances Andrews.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see a dog that had been kicked
all its life?&rdquo; went on Mabel; &ldquo;how it snarls and
bites and snaps at anybody who tries to pet it?
Well, Frances is just a poor kicked dog. She&rsquo;s
done something she ought not to have done, and
she&rsquo;s been kicked out for it, and she&rsquo;s so sore and
unhappy, she snarls at everybody who comes
near her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mabel, you&rsquo;re a brick!&rdquo; exclaimed Sallie
Marks. &ldquo;I started the fight this morning and
I&rsquo;m ashamed of it. I&rsquo;m going to make a resolution
to be nice to that poor girl hereafter, no
matter how horrid she is. It will be an interesting
experiment, if for no other reason.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s form a society,&rdquo; put in Molly, &ldquo;to reinstate
Frances Andrews, and the way to do it
will be to be as nice as we can to her and to say
nice things about her to the other girls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good work!&rdquo; cried Margaret Wakefield,
scenting another opportunity to draw up a constitution,
by-laws and resolutions. &ldquo;We will call
a first meeting right now, and elect officers. I
move that Molly be made chairman of the meeting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I second the motion,&rdquo; said Sallie heartily.
&ldquo;All in favor say &lsquo;aye.&rsquo;&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a chorus of laughing &ldquo;ayes&rdquo; and a
society was actually established that morning,
Molly, as founder, being elected President. It
consisted of eight members, all freshmen, except
the good-natured Sallie Marks, who condescended,
although a junior, to join.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose we vote on a name now,&rdquo; continued
Margaret who wished to leave nothing undone
in creating the club. &ldquo;Each member has a right
to suggest two names, votes to be taken afterward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was all very business-like, owing to Margaret&rsquo;s
experienced methods, but the girls enjoyed
it and felt quite important. As a matter
of fact, it was the first society to be established
that year in the freshman class, and it developed
afterward into a very important organization.</p>

<p>Among the various names suggested were
&ldquo;The Optimists,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Bluebirds,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Glad
Hands,&rdquo; mentioned by Sallie Marks, and &ldquo;The
Happy Hearts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are all too sentimental,&rdquo; said the astute
Margaret, looking them over. &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be so
many croaks about us if we choose one of these
names that we&rsquo;ll be crushed with ridicule. How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
about these initials&mdash;&lsquo;G.F.&rsquo; What do they stand
for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gold Fishes,&rdquo; replied Mabel Hinton promptly.
The others laughed, but the name pleased them,
nevertheless. &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; went on Mabel, &ldquo;a
gold fish always radiates a cheerful glow no matter
where he is. He is the most amiable, contented
little optimist in the animal kingdom, and
he swims just as happily in a finger bowl as he
does in a fish pond. He was evidently created
to cheer up the fish tribe and I&rsquo;m sure he must
succeed in doing it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The explanation was received with applause,
and when the votes were taken, &ldquo;G.F.&rdquo; was
chosen without a dissenting voice.</p>

<p>It was decided that the club was to meet once
a week, it&rsquo;s object, to be, in a way, the promotion
of kindliness, especially toward such people
as Frances Andrews, who were friendless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be something like the Misericordia Society
in Italy,&rdquo; observed Judy, &ldquo;only, instead of
looking after wounded and hurt people, we&rsquo;ll
look after wounded and hurt feelings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was further moved, seconded and the motion
carried that the society should be a secret
one; that reports should be read each week by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
members who had anything to report; and, by
way of infusing a little sociability into the society,
it was to give an entertainment, something
unique in the annals of Wellington; subject to
be thought of later.</p>

<p>It was noon by the time the first meeting of
the G.&nbsp;F. Society was ready to disband. But the
girls had really enjoyed it. In the first place,
there was an important feeling about being an
initial member of a club which had such a beneficial
object, and was to be so delightfully secretive.
There was, in fact, a good deal of knight
errantry in the purpose of the G.&nbsp;F.&rsquo;s, who felt
not a little like Amazonian cavaliers looking for
adventure on the highway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, you know,&rdquo; observed Jessie, &ldquo;we
should be called &lsquo;The Friends of the Wallflowers,&rsquo;
like some men at home, who made up their
minds one New Year&rsquo;s night at a ball to give a
poor cross-eyed, ugly girl who never had partners
the time of her life, just once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did they do it?&rdquo; asked Nance, who imagined
that she was a wallflower, and was always conscious
when the name was mentioned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They certainly did,&rdquo; answered Jessie, &ldquo;and
when I saw the girl afterward in the dressing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
room, she said to me, &lsquo;Oh, Jessie, wasn&rsquo;t it
heaven?&rsquo; She cried a little. I was ashamed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the way, Jessie, I never got my compliment,&rdquo;
said Molly. &ldquo;Pay it to me this instant,
or I shall be thinking I haven&rsquo;t had a &lsquo;square
deal.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, here it is,&rdquo; answered Jessie. &ldquo;It has
been passed along considerably, but it&rsquo;s all the
more valuable for taking such a roundabout
route to get to you. I&rsquo;ll warn you beforehand
that you will probably have an electric shock
when you hear it. You know I have some
cousins who live up in New York. One of them
writes to me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Girl or man?&rdquo; demanded Judy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Man,&rdquo; answered Jessie, blushing.</p>

<p>There was a laugh at this, because Jessie&rsquo;s
beaux were numerous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His best friend,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;has a sister,
and that sister&mdash;do you follow&mdash;is an intimate
friend&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;An intimate friend of an intimate friend,&rsquo;&rdquo;
one of the girls interrupted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jessie, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s obscure, but perfectly
logical. My cousin&rsquo;s intimate friend&rsquo;s sister has
an intimate friend&mdash;Miss Green&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, ho!&rdquo; cried Judy. &ldquo;Now we are getting
down to rock bottom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Miss Green told her intimate friend who
told my cousin&rsquo;s intimate friend&rsquo;s sister&mdash;it&rsquo;s a
little involved, but I think I have it straight&mdash;who
told her brother who told my cousin who
wrote it to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what did he write,&rdquo; they demanded in a
chorus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That one of Miss Green&rsquo;s brothers was
crushed on a charming red-headed girl from
Kentucky.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly&rsquo;s face turned crimson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Dodo is crushed on Judy,&rdquo; she laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may be,&rdquo; said Jessie. &ldquo;Rumors are most
generally twisted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The first meeting of the G.&nbsp;F.&rsquo;s now disbanded
and the members scattered to dress for the early
Sunday dinner. They all attended Vespers that
afternoon, and in the quiet hour of the impressive
service more than one pondered seriously
upon the conversation of the morning and the
purpose of the new club.</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />

<small>TRICKERY.</small></h2>


<p>It was several days before the G.&nbsp;F.&rsquo;s had an
opportunity to practise any of their new resolutions
on Frances Andrews. The eccentric girl
was in the habit of skipping meals and eating at
off hours at a little restaurant in the village, or
taking ice cream sundaes in the drug store.</p>

<p>At last, however, she did appear at supper in
a beautiful dinner dress of lavender crêpe de
chine with an immense bunch of violets pinned
at her belt. She looked very handsome and the
girls could not refrain from giving her covert
glances of admiration as she took her seat stonily
at the table.</p>

<p>It was the impetuous, precipitate Judy who
took the lead in the promotion of kindliness and
her premature act came near to cutting down the
new club in its budding infancy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must be going to a party,&rdquo; she began,
flashing one of her ingratiating smiles at
Frances.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>Frances looked at her with an icy stare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I mean,&rdquo; stammered Judy, &ldquo;you are wearing
such an exquisite dress. It&rsquo;s too fine for ordinary
occasions like this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frances rose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Markham,&rdquo; she said to the matron of
Queen&rsquo;s, &ldquo;if I can&rsquo;t eat here without having my
clothes sneered at, I shall be obliged to have my
meals carried to my room hereafter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she marched out of the dining room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Markham looked greatly embarrassed
and nobody spoke for some time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; said Judy at last in a low
voice to Molly, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s to be done now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you write her a little note,&rdquo; replied
Molly, &ldquo;and tell her that you hadn&rsquo;t meant
to hurt her feelings and had honestly admired
her dress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Apologize!&rdquo; exclaimed Judy, her proud spirit
recoiling at the ignoble thought. &ldquo;I simply
couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But since her attack on Molly, Judy had been
very much ashamed of herself, and she was now
taking what she called &ldquo;self-control in broken
doses,&rdquo; like the calomel treatment; that night
she actually wrote a note to Frances and shoved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
it under the door. In answer to this abject missive
she received one line, written with purple
ink on highly scented heavy note paper:</p>

<div class="smallnote"><p>&ldquo;Dear Miss Kean,&rdquo; it ran, &ldquo;I accept your
apology.</p>

<p><span class="rght2">&ldquo;Yours sincerely,</span><br />
<span class="rght1">&ldquo;Frances Le Grand Andrews.&rdquo;</span><br />
</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;Le Grand, that&rsquo;s a good name for her,&rdquo;
laughed Judy, sniffing at the perfumed paper
with some disgust.</p>

<p>But she wrote an elaborate report regarding
the incident and read it aloud to the assembled
G.&nbsp;F.&rsquo;s at their second meeting.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Sallie Marks had her innings
with the redoubtable Frances, and retreated,
wearing the sad and martyred smile of one who
is determined not to resent an insult. One by
one the G.F.&rsquo;s took occasion to be polite and kind
to the scornful, suspicious Frances. Her malicious
speeches were ignored and her vulgarities&mdash;and
she had many of them&mdash;passed lightly
over. Little by little she arrived at the conclusion
that refinement did not mean priggishness
and that vulgarity was not humor. Of course
the change came very gradually. Not infrequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
after a sophomore snub, the whipped dog
snarled savagely; or she would brazenly try to
shock the supper table with a coarse, slangy
speech. But with the persistent friendliness of
the Queen&rsquo;s girls, the fires in her nature began
to die down and the intervals between flare-ups
grew longer each day.</p>

<p>Frances Andrews was the first &ldquo;subject&rdquo; of
the G.F.&rsquo;s, and they were as interested in her
regeneration as a group of learned doctors in
the recovery of a dangerously ill patient.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the busy college life hummed
on and Molly felt her head swimming sometimes
with its variety and fullness. What with
coaching Judy, blacking boots, making certain
delicious sweetmeats called &ldquo;cloudbursts,&rdquo;&mdash;the
recipe of which was her own secret,&mdash;which
sold like hot cakes; keeping up the social end
and the study end, Molly was beginning to feel
tired. A wanness began to show in the dark
shadows under her eyes and the pinched look
about her lips even as early as the eventful evening
when she posed for the senior living picture
show.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This child needs some make-up,&rdquo; the august
senior president had exclaimed. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
rouge and who&rsquo;s got my rabbit&rsquo;s foot? No,
burned cork makes too broad a line. Give me
one of the lighter colored eyebrow pencils. You
mustn&rsquo;t lose your color, little girl,&rdquo; she said,
dabbing a spot of red on each of Molly&rsquo;s pale
cheeks. &ldquo;Your roses are one of your chief attractions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A great many students and some of the faculty
had bought tickets for this notable occasion,
and the gymnasium was well filled before
the curtain was drawn back from a gigantic
gold frame disclosing Mary Stewart as Joan of
Arc in the picture by Bastien Le Page, which
hangs in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in
New York. There was no attempt to reproduce
the atmospheric visions of the angel and the
knight in armor, only the poor peasant girl
standing in the cabbage patch, her face transfigured
with inspiration. When Molly saw
Mary Stewart pose in this picture at the dress
rehearsal, she could not help recalling the story
of the bootblack father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has a wonderful face, and I call it beautiful,
if other people don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said to herself.</p>

<p>As for our little freshman, so dazed and heavy
was she with fatigue, the night of the entertainment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
that she never knew she had created a sensation,
first as Botticelli&rsquo;s &ldquo;Flora,&rdquo; barefooted and
wearing a Greek dress constructed of cheesecloth,
and then as &ldquo;Mrs. Hamilton,&rdquo; in the blue
crepe with a gauzy fichu around her neck.</p>

<p>After the exhibition, when all the actors were
endeavoring to collect their belongings in the
confusion of the green room, Sallie Marks came
running behind the scenes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prexy has specially requested you to repeat
the Flora picture,&rdquo; she announced, breathlessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Prexy here?&rdquo; they demanded, with much
excitement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is so,&rdquo; answered Sallie. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s up in
the balcony with Professor Green and Miss
Pomeroy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you think, we&rsquo;ve been performing
before &lsquo;Queen Victoria and other members
of the royal family,&rsquo; like P.&nbsp;T. Barnum, and
never knew a thing about it,&rdquo; said a funny snub-nosed
senior. &ldquo;&lsquo;Daily demonstrations by the
delighted multitude almost taking the form of
ovations,&rsquo;&rdquo; she proceeded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk so much, Lulu, and help us, for
Heaven&rsquo;s sake! Where&rsquo;s Molly Brown of Kentucky?&rdquo;
called the distracted President.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>Molly came forth at the summons. Overcome
by an extreme fatigue, she had been sitting on a
bench in a remote corner of the room behind
some stage property.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, little one, take off your shoes and stockings,
and get into your Flora costume, quick, by
order of Prexy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a few minutes, Molly stood poised on the
tips of her toes in the gold frame. The lights
went down, the bell rang, and the curtains were
parted by two freshmen appointed for this duty.
For one brief fleeting glance the audience saw
the immortal Flora floating on thin air apparently,
and then the entire gymnasium was in total
darkness.</p>

<p>A wave of conversation and giggling filled the
void of blackness, while on the stage the seniors
were rushing around, falling over each other and
calling for matches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s light manager?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Lulu?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lulu! Lulu!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the switch?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lulu&rsquo;s asleep at the switch,&rdquo; sang a chorus of
juniors from the audience.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; called Lulu. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here on the job,
but the switch doesn&rsquo;t work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Telephone to the engineer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Light the gas somebody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But there were no matches, and the only man
in the house was in the balcony. However, he
managed to grope his way to the steps leading
to the platform, where he suddenly struck a
match, to the wild joy of the audience. Choruses
from various quarters had been calling:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t blow out the gas!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep it dark!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And one girl created a laugh by announcing:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The present picture represents a &lsquo;Nocturne&rsquo;
by Whistler.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the janitor began lighting gas jets along
the wall and finally a lonesome gas jet on the
stage faintly illumined the scene of confusion.</p>

<p>The gigantic gilt frame outlined a dark picture
of hurrying forms, and huddled in the foreground
lay a limp white object, for Botticelli&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Flora&rdquo; had fainted away.</p>

<p>The confusion increased. The President
joined the excited seniors and presently the doctor
appeared, fetched by the Professor of English
Literature. &ldquo;Flora&rdquo; was lifted onto a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
couch; her own gray cape thrown over her, and
opening her eyes in a few minutes, she became
Molly Brown of Kentucky. She gazed confusedly
at the faces hovering over her in the half
light; the doctor at one side, the <a name="President" id="President"></a>President at the
other; Mary Stewart and Professor Green standing
at the foot and a crowd of seniors like a mob
in the background.</p>

<p>Suddenly Molly sat up. She brushed her auburn
hair from her face and pointed vaguely toward
the hall:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw her when she&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she began. Her
eye caught Professor Green&rsquo;s, and she fell back
on the couch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You saw what, my child?&rdquo; asked the President
kindly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon I was just dreaming,&rdquo; answered
Molly, her Southern accent more marked than
ever before.</p>

<p>The President of the senior class now hurried
up to the President of Wellington University.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Walker,&rdquo; she exclaimed, her voice trembling
with indignation, &ldquo;we have just found out,
or, rather, the engineer has discovered, that some
one has cut the electric wires. It was a clean cut,
right through. I do think it was an outrage.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
She was almost sobbing in her righteous anger.</p>

<p>The President&rsquo;s face looked very grave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure of this?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; put in the engineer, who
had followed close on the heels of the senior.</p>

<p>Without a word, President Walker rose and
walked to the centre of the platform. With much
subdued merriment the students were leaving the
gymnasium in a body. Lifting a small chair
standing near, she rapped with it on the floor for
order. Instantly, every student faced the platform,
and those who had not reached the aisles
sat down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Young ladies,&rdquo; began the President in her
calm, cultivated tones that could strike terror to
the heart of any erring student, &ldquo;I wish to speak
a word with you before you leave the gymnasium
to-night. Probably most of you are aware by
this time that the accident to the electric lighting
was really not an accident at all, but the result of
a deliberate act by some one in this room. Of
course, I realize, that in so large a body of students
as we have at Wellington University there
must, of necessity, be some black sheep. These
we endeavor, by every effort, to regenerate and
by mid-years it is usually not a difficult matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
to discover those who are in earnest and those
who consider Wellington College merely a place
of amusement. Those who do consider it as
such, naturally, do not&mdash;er&mdash;remain with us
after mid-years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To Molly, sitting on the platform, and to other
trembling freshmen in the audience, the President
seemed for the moment like a great and
stern judge, who had appointed mid-years as the
time for a general execution of criminals.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I consider,&rdquo; went on the speaker in slow and
even tones, &ldquo;idleness a most unfortunate quality,
and I am prepared to combat it and to convince
any of my girls who show that tendency that
good hard work and only good hard work will
bring success. A great many girls come here
preferring idleness and learn to repent it&mdash;before
mid-years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A wave of subdued laughter swept over the
audience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said the President, her voice growing
louder and sterner, &ldquo;young ladies, I am not prepared
to combat chicanery and trickery by anything
except the most severe measures, and if
there is one among you who thinks and believes
she can commit such despicable follies as that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
which has been done to-night, and escape&mdash;I
would say to her that she is mistaken. I shall
not endure such treachery. It shall be rooted
out. For the honor and the illustrious name of
this institution, I now ask each one of you to
help me, and if there is one among you who
knows the culprit and does not report it to me
at once, I shall hold that girl as responsible as
the real culprit. You may go now, and think
well over what I have said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The President retired and the students filed
soberly and quietly from the gymnasium.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you feel now, dear?&rdquo; asked President
Walker, leaning over Molly and taking her
hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Much better, thank you,&rdquo; answered Molly,
timidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could you hear what I was saying to the
girls?&rdquo; continued the President, looking at her
closely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; faltered Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think over it, then. And you had better
stay in bed a few days until you feel better.
Have you prescribed for her, doctor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor nodded. He was a bluff, kindly
Scotchman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;A little anæmic and tired out. A good tonic
and more sleep will put her to rights.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary Stewart had telephoned for a carriage
to take Molly home, and Judy, filled with passionate
devotion when anything was the matter,
hurried ahead to turn down the bed, lay out
gown and wrapper and make a cup of bouillon
out of hot water and a beef juice capsule; and
finally assist her beloved friend&mdash;whom she occasionally
chastened&mdash;to remove her clothes and
get into bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I may not have many chances to wait on you,
Molly, darling,&rdquo; she exclaimed, when Molly protested
at so much devotion. &ldquo;I may not have a
chance after mid-years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If she had mentioned death itself, she could
not have used a more tragic tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Judy,&rdquo; cried Molly, slipping her arms around
her friend&rsquo;s neck, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to let you go at
mid-years if I have to study for two.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br />

<small>AN INSPIRATION.</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;This is like having a bedroom <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salon</i>,&rdquo; exclaimed
Molly with a hospitable smile to some
dozen guests who adorned the divans and easy
chairs, the floor and window sills of her room.</p>

<p>Surely there was nothing Molly liked better
than to entertain, and when she had callers,
she always entertained them with refreshments
of some kind. Often it had to be crackers and
sweet chocolate, and she had even been reduced
to tea. But usually her family kept her supplied
with good things and her larder was generally
well stocked.</p>

<p>She lay in bed, propped up with pillows, and
scattered about the bed were text-books and
papers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been studying again, you naughty
child,&rdquo; exclaimed Mary Stewart, shaking her
finger. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t Dr. McLean tell you to go easy
for the next week?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Go easy, indeed,&rdquo; laughed Molly. &ldquo;You
might as well tell a trapeze actor to do the giant-swing
and hold on tight at the same time. But
it&rsquo;s worth losing a few days to find out what
loving friends I have. Your pink roses are the
loveliest of all,&rdquo; she added, squeezing her friend&rsquo;s
hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell us exactly who sent you each bunch?&rdquo;
demanded Jessie, passing a box of ginger-snaps,
while Judy performed miracles with a tea ball,
a small kettle and a varied assortment of cups
and saucers. &ldquo;I have a right to ask you,&rdquo; continued
Jessica, &ldquo;because you asked the same
question of me last Tuesday when two boxes
came.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No suitor sent me any of these, Mistress Jessica,&rdquo;
answered Molly, &ldquo;because I haven&rsquo;t any.
Miss Stewart sent the pink ones, and the President
of the senior class sent the red ones. Judy
brought me the double violets and Nance the
lilies of the valley, bless them both, and another
senior the pot of pansies. The seniors have certainly
been sweet and lovely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one you haven&rsquo;t accounted for,&rdquo; interrupted
Jessie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The violets?&rdquo; asked Molly, blushing slightly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, ho!&rdquo; cried Jessie in her high, musical
voice, &ldquo;trying to crawl, were you? You can&rsquo;t deceive
old Grandmamma Sharp-eyes. Honor
bright, who sent the violets?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To tell you the truth, I don&rsquo;t know. I suspected
Frances Andrews, but when I thanked
her for them, she looked horribly embarrassed
and said she hadn&rsquo;t sent them. I was afraid she
would go down and get some after my break, but
thank goodness, she had the good taste not to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean to say they were anonymous?&rdquo; demanded
Jessie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean to say that thing, but I suppose some
of the seniors who preferred to remain unknown
sent them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just possible,&rdquo; put in Mary, and the subject
was dropped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s talk about the only thing worth talking
about just now,&rdquo; broke in Judy. &ldquo;The Flopping
of Flora; or, Who Cut the Wires?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why talk about it?&rdquo; said Molly. &ldquo;You could
never reach any conclusion, and guessing doesn&rsquo;t
help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, just as a matter of interest,&rdquo; replied
Judy. &ldquo;For instance, if we were detectives and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
put on the case, how would we go about finding
the criminal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should look for a silly mischief-maker,&rdquo;
said Mary Stewart. &ldquo;Some foolish girl who
wanted to do a clever thing. Freshmen at boys&rsquo;
colleges are often like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think it was a freshman, do you,
Miss Stewart?&rdquo; cried Mabel Hinton, turning
her round spectacles on Mary like a large, serious
owl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, indeed. I was only joking. I haven&rsquo;t
the remotest notion who it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I were a detective on the case,&rdquo; said Mabel
Hinton, &ldquo;I should look for a junior who was
jealous of the seniors. Some one who had a
grudge, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I were a detective,&rdquo; announced Margaret
Wakefield, in her most judicial manner, &ldquo;I should
look for some one who had a grudge against
Molly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course; I never thought of that. It did
happen just as Molly was about to give the encore,
didn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It did,&rdquo; answered Margaret.</p>

<p>The girls had all stopped chattering in duets
and trios to listen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Has any one in the world the heart to have
a grudge against you, you sweet child?&rdquo; exclaimed
Mary Stewart, placing her rather large,
strong hand over Molly&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>The young freshman looked uncomfortable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; she said, smiling faintly. &ldquo;I
never meant to give offence to any one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pretty soon the company dispersed and Molly
was left alone with her two best friends.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Judy,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;will you please settle down
to work this instant? You know you have to
write your theme and get it in by to-morrow
noon, and you haven&rsquo;t touched it so far.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nance was already deep in her English.
Molly turned her face to the wall and sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; she whispered to herself; &ldquo;I
simply cannot do it.&rdquo; But what she referred to
only she herself knew.</p>

<p>In the meantime Judy chewed the end of her
pencil and looked absently at her friend&rsquo;s back.
Presently she gave the pad on her lap an impatient
toss in one direction and the pencil in another,
and flung herself on the foot of Molly&rsquo;s
couch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t scold me, Molly. I never compose, except
under inspiration, and inspiration doesn&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
seem to be on very good terms with me just now.
She hasn&rsquo;t visited me in an age.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! You know perfectly well you can
write that theme if you set your mind to it, Judy
Kean. You are just too lazy. You haven&rsquo;t even
chosen a subject, I&rsquo;ll wager anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Judy sadly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you write a short story? You
have plenty of material with all your travel&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know what I&rsquo;ll write,&rdquo; Judy interrupted her
excitedly, &ldquo;The Motives of Crime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How absurd,&rdquo; objected Molly. &ldquo;Besides,
don&rsquo;t you think that&rsquo;s a little personal just now,
when the whole school is talking about the wire-cutter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all. We are all trying to run down
the criminal, anyhow. I shall take the five great
motives which lead to crime: anger, jealousy,
hatred, envy and greed. It will make an interesting
discourse. You&rsquo;ll see if it doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The idea of your writing on such a subject,&rdquo;
laughed Molly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not a criminal lawyer
or a prosecuting attorney.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I admit it,&rdquo; answered Judy, &ldquo;and I suppose
Lawyer Margaret Wakefield ought to be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
one to handle the subject. But, nevertheless, I
am fired with inspiration, and I intend to write
it myself. I shall not see you again until the
deed is done, if it takes all night. By the way,
lend me some coffee, will you? I&rsquo;m all out, and
I always make some on the samovar for keeping-awake
purposes when I&rsquo;m going to work at
night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m going to do with you,
Judy,&rdquo; sighed Molly, as the incorrigible girl
sailed out of the room, a jar of coffee under one
arm and her writing pad under the other.</p>

<p>At first she wrote intermittently, rumpling up
her hair with both hands and chewing her pencil
savagely; but gradually her thoughts took form
and the pencil moved steadily along, almost like
&ldquo;spirit-writing&rdquo; it seemed to her, until the essay
was done. It was half-past three o&rsquo;clock and
rain and hail beat a dismal tattoo on her window
pane. She had not even noticed the storm, having
hung a bed quilt over her window and tacked
a dressing gown across the transom to conceal
the light of the student&rsquo;s lamp from the watchful
matron. Putting out her light and removing
all signs of disobedience, she now cheerfully
went to bed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Motives for crime,&rdquo; she chuckled to herself.
&ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;m committing a small crime for disobeying
the ten-o&rsquo;clock rule, and my motive is
to hand in a theme on time to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next morning when Judy read over her
night&rsquo;s work, she enjoyed it very much. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
really quite interesting,&rdquo; she said to herself. &ldquo;I
really don&rsquo;t see how I ever did it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She delivered the essay at Miss Pomeroy&rsquo;s office
and felt vastly proud when she laid it on the
table near the desk. Her own cleverness told
her that she had done a good thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe Wordsworth ever enjoyed
his own works more than I do mine,&rdquo; she observed,
as she strolled across the campus. &ldquo;And
because I&rsquo;ve been <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon enfant</i>, I shall now take a
rest and go forth in search of amusement.&rdquo; She
turned her face toward the village, where a kind
of Oriental bazaar was being held by some
Syrians. It would be fun, she thought, to look
over their bangles and slippers and bead necklaces.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Miss Pomeroy was engaged
in reading over Judy&rsquo;s theme, which, having
been handed in last, had come to her notice first.
Such is the luck of the procrastinator.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>She smiled when she saw the title, but the
theme interested her greatly, and presently she
tucked it into her long reticule, familiar to every
Wellington girl, and hastened over to the President&rsquo;s
house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Emma,&rdquo; she said (the two women were old
college mates, and were Emma and Louise in
private), &ldquo;I think this might interest you. It&rsquo;s
a theme by one of my freshman girls. A strange
subject for a girl of seventeen, but she&rsquo;s quite a
remarkable person, if she would only apply herself.
Somehow, it seems, whether consciously
or unconsciously, to bear on what has been occupying
us all so much since last Friday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The President put on her glasses and began
to read Judy&rsquo;s theme. Every now and then she
gave a low, amused chuckle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The child writes like Marie Corelli,&rdquo; she exclaimed,
laughing. &ldquo;And yet it is clever and it
does suggest&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she paused and frowned. &ldquo;I
wonder if she could and doesn&rsquo;t dare tell?&rdquo; she
added slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; echoed Miss Pomeroy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is she one of the Queen&rsquo;s Cottage girls?
They appear to be rather a remarkable lot this
year.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Some of them are very bright,&rdquo; said Miss
Pomeroy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Louise,&rdquo; said the President suddenly,
&ldquo;Frances Andrews is one of the girls at that
house, is she not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; nodded the other, with a queer look on
her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s clever,&rdquo; said the President. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
deep, Emma. It is impossible to make any definite
statement about her. One must go very
slowly in these things. But after what happened
last year, you know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She paused. Even with her most intimate
friend she disliked to discuss certain secrets of
the institution openly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Miss Pomeroy, &ldquo;she is either very
deep or entirely innocent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some one is guilty,&rdquo; sighed the President. &ldquo;I
do wish I knew who it was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy&rsquo;s theme not only received especial mention
by Miss Pomeroy, but it was read aloud to the
entire class and was later published in the college
paper, <cite>The Commune</cite>, to Judy&rsquo;s everlasting
joy and glory. She was congratulated about it
on all sides and her heart was swollen with pride.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll take to writing in dead earnest,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
she said to Molly, &ldquo;because I have the happy faculty
of writing on subjects I don&rsquo;t know anything
about, and no one knows the difference.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d take to doing anything in dead
earnest,&rdquo; Molly replied, giving her friend a little
impatient shake.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br />

<small>PLANNING AND WISHING.</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Anna Oldham, the famous suffragette,
will speak in the gymnasium on Saturday afternoon,
at four o&rsquo;clock, on &lsquo;Woman&rsquo;s Suffrage.&rsquo;
All those interested in this subject are invited to
be present.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly and Judy, with a crowd of friends, on
the way from one classroom to another one busy
Friday had paused in front of the bulletin board
in the main corridor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Anna Oldham?&rdquo; they repeated, trying
to remember where they had heard the name before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Judy,&rdquo; whispered Molly, &ldquo;that must be
Nance&rsquo;s mother. Do you&mdash;do you suppose Nance
knows?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If she does, she has never mentioned it. You
know she never tells anything. She&rsquo;s a perfect
clam. But this, somehow, is different.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Both girls thought of their own mothers immediately.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
Surely they would have shouted aloud
such news as Nance had.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall we mention it to her, or do you think
we&rsquo;d better wait and let her introduce the subject?&rdquo;
asked Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely she corresponds with her own
mother,&rdquo; exclaimed Judy without answering
Molly&rsquo;s question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her father writes to her about once a week,
I know; but I don&rsquo;t think she hears very often
from Mrs. Oldham. You see, her mother&rsquo;s away
most of the time lecturing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lecturing&mdash;fiddlesticks!&rdquo; cried Judy indignantly.
&ldquo;What kind of a mother is she, I&rsquo;d like
to know? I&rsquo;ll bet you anything Nance doesn&rsquo;t
know at all she&rsquo;s going to be here. I think we
ought to tell her, Molly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Nance,&rdquo; answered Molly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
which would mortify her most: to know or not
to know. Suppose we find out in some tactful
roundabout way whether she knows, and then
I&rsquo;ll offer to go in with you Saturday night and
give her mother my bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy cordially consented to this arrangement,
having a three-quarter bed in her small room, although
secretly she was not fond of sharing it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
and preferred both her bed and her room to herself.</p>

<p>It was not until much later in the day that
they saw Nance, who appeared to be radiantly
and buoyantly happy. Her usually quiet face
was aglow with a soft light, and as she passed
her two friends she waved a letter at them
gayly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, she knows and she is delighted,&rdquo; exclaimed
Judy. &ldquo;Just as we would be. Oh,
Molly, wait until you see my mother, if you want
to meet a thing of beauty and a joy forever.
You&rsquo;d think I was her mother instead of her being
mine, she is so little and sweet and dainty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she coming up soon? I&rsquo;d dearly love
to meet her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not. You know papa is always
flying off on trips and mamma goes with him
everywhere. I used to, too, before I decided to
be educated. It was awfully exciting. We often
got ready on a day&rsquo;s notice to go thousands of
miles, to San Francisco or Alaska or Mexico,
anywhere. Papa is exactly like me, or, rather,
I am exactly like him, only he is a hundred times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
better looking and more fascinating and charming
than I can ever hope to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You funny child,&rdquo; exclaimed Molly; &ldquo;how do
you know you are not all those things right
now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; sighed Judy. &ldquo;Papa is
brilliant, and not a bit lazy. He works all the
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So would you if you only wanted to. You
only choose to be lazy. If I had your mind and
opportunities there is no end to what I would
do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy looked at her in surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Molly, do you think I have any mind?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of the best in the freshman class,&rdquo; answered
her friend. &ldquo;But look, here are some
letters!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She paused in the hall of Queen&rsquo;s Cottage to
look over a pile of mail which had been brought
that afternoon.</p>

<p>There were several letters for the girls; Judy&rsquo;s
bi-weeklies from both her parents, who wrote to
her assiduously, and Molly&rsquo;s numerous home
epistles from her sisters and mother. But there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
were two, one for each of the girls, with the
Exmoor postmark on them.</p>

<p>Molly opened hers first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Judy,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;do you remember
that nice Exmoor Sophomore named &lsquo;Upton?&rsquo;
He wants to come over Saturday afternoon to
call and go walking. Dodo has probably written
the same thing to you. I see you have an Exmoor
letter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has,&rdquo; answered Judy, perusing her note.
&ldquo;He wishes the honor of my company for a
short walk. Evidently they don&rsquo;t think we have
many engagements since they don&rsquo;t give us time
to answer their notes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Judy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Molly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two girls looked at each other for a brief
moment and then broke into a laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nance&rsquo;s letter must have been from one of
the others, Andy McLean, perhaps, that was why
she was so&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy paused. Somehow, it didn&rsquo;t seem very
kind to imply that poor Nance was elated over
her first beau.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear, sweet old Nance!&rdquo; cried Molly, her
heart warming to her friend. &ldquo;She will probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
have them by the dozens some of these
days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I should camp on her trail if I were
a man,&rdquo; said Judy loyally. &ldquo;But, Molly,&rdquo; she
added, laughing again, &ldquo;what are we to do about
old Mrs. Oldham?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear! I hadn&rsquo;t thought of that. And
poor Nance would have enjoyed the walk so
much more than a learned discourse on woman&rsquo;s
rights.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just before supper time Nance burst into the
room. She was humming a waltz tune; her
cheeks looked flushed, and she went briskly over
to the mirror and glanced at her image quickly,
while she took off her tam and sweater.</p>

<p>The girls had never seen her looking so pretty.
They waited for her to mention the note, but she
talked of other things until Judy, always impatient
to force events, exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was that note you were waving at us
this afternoon, Nance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that was from&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A tap on the door interrupted her and Margaret
Wakefield entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Nance,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I am so excited over
your mother&rsquo;s coming to speak at college to-morrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
afternoon. Isn&rsquo;t it fine of her? It&rsquo;s Miss
Bowles, Professor in Advanced Math., who is
bringing her, you know, of course?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Except that her face turned perfectly white,
Nance showed no sign whatever that she had received
a staggering blow, but her two friends
felt for her deeply and Molly came to her rescue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the way, Nance, dearest,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I
thought you might want to have your mother
with you to-morrow night, and I was going to
offer you my bed and turn in with Judy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Molly,&rdquo; answered Nance, huskily;
&ldquo;that would be nice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Very little ever escaped the alert eyes of Margaret
Wakefield; but if she noticed anything
strange in Nance&rsquo;s manner, she made no comment
whatever. She was a fine girl, full of
sympathy and understanding, with a certain
well-bred dignity of manner that is seldom seen
in a young girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be quite a gala event at Queen&rsquo;s if
Mrs. Oldham eats supper here,&rdquo; she said gently;
&ldquo;but no doubt she will be claimed by some of the
faculty.&rdquo; Then she slipped quietly out of the
room, just in time, for quiet, self-contained Nance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
burst suddenly into a storm of weeping and flung
herself on the bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And she never even took the trouble to tell
me,&rdquo; she sobbed brokenly. &ldquo;She has probably
forgotten that I am even going to Wellington.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a difficult moment for Molly and Judy.
Would it be more tactful to slip out of the room
or to try and comfort Nance? After all, she had
had very little sympathy in her life, and sympathy
was what she craved and love, too, Molly felt
sure of this, and with an instinct stronger than
reason, she slipped down beside her friend on the
couch and put her arms around her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Darling, sweetest Nance,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I am
sure the message will come. Perhaps she&rsquo;ll telegraph,
and they will telephone from the village.
Judy and I love you so dearly, it breaks our
hearts to see you cry like this. Doesn&rsquo;t it,
Judy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, it does,&rdquo; answered Judy, who was
kneeling at the side of the couch with her cheek
against Nance&rsquo;s hand.</p>

<p>It was a comfort to Nance to realize that she
had gained the friendship and affection of these
two loving, warm-hearted girls. Never in her
life had she met any girls like them, and presently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
the bitterness in her heart began to melt
away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps she will telegraph,&rdquo; she said, drying
her eyes. &ldquo;It was silly of me to take on so, but,
you see, I had a little shock&mdash;I&rsquo;m all right now.
You&rsquo;re dears, both of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy went into her own room and returned in
a moment with a large bottle of German cologne.
Filling the stationary wash basin with cold water
she poured in a liberal quantity of the cologne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, dearest Nance,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;bathe your
face in that, and then powder with Molly&rsquo;s pink
rice powder, and all will be as if it never had
been,&rdquo; she added, smiling.</p>

<p>The others smiled, too. Somehow, Nance&rsquo;s
outburst had done her more good than harm. For
the first time in her life she had been coddled
and sympathized with and petted. It was almost
worth while to have suffered to have gained
such rewards. After all, there were some pleasant
things in life. For instance, the note which
had come to her that afternoon from young
Andy McLean, son of Dr. McLean, the college
physician. To think that she, &ldquo;the little gray
mouse,&rdquo; as her father had often called her, had
inspired any one with a desire to see her again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
It was almost impossible to believe, but there was
the young Scotchman&rsquo;s note to refute all contrary
arguments.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Miss Oldham</span>,&rdquo; it said, in a good,
round handwriting, &ldquo;I have been wanting so
much to see you again since our jolly day at Exmoor.
I am bringing some fellows over on Saturday
to supper at my father&rsquo;s. If you should
happen to be in about four o&rsquo;clock, may I call?
How about a walk before supper? I can&rsquo;t tell
you how disappointed I&rsquo;ll be if you have another
engagement.</p>

<p><span class="rght3">&ldquo;Yours sincerely,</span><br />
<span class="rght1">&ldquo;Andrew McLean, 2d.&rdquo;</span><br />
</p></div>

<p>Of course, she would have to give up the walk
now, but it was pleasant to have been remembered
and perhaps he would come again.</p>

<p>That night at supper Nance was unusually
bright and talkative. She answered all the many
questions concerning her famous mother so
easily and pleasantly that even Margaret Wakefield
must have been deceived.</p>

<p>The two sophomores at Queen&rsquo;s were giving a
dance that evening, and while the girls sat in the
long sitting room waiting for the guests to arrive,
Judy took occasion to whisper to Molly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should she have to appear at the lecture,
anyhow?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Because it would be disrespectful not to,&rdquo;
answered Molly. &ldquo;She must be there, of course.
Would you go gallivanting off with a young man
if your mother was going to give a lecture here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should say not; but that&rsquo;s different.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; persisted Molly; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s never different
when it&rsquo;s your mother, even when she doesn&rsquo;t
behave like one. Can&rsquo;t you see that Nance would
rather die than have people know that her mother
isn&rsquo;t exactly like other mothers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next day was one of the busiest in the
week for Molly. Two of her morning hours she
spent coaching Judy in Latin. Then there were
her lace collars to be done up, her stockings to
be darned; a trip to be made to the library, where
she stood in line for more than twenty minutes
waiting for a certain volume of the Encyclopædia
Britannica, and spent more than an hour extracting
notes on &ldquo;Norse Mythology.&rdquo; It was
well on toward lunch time when she finally hastened
across the campus to Queen&rsquo;s to fill some
orders for &ldquo;cloud-bursts,&rdquo; which were intended
to be part of the refreshments for certain Saturday
evening suppers.</p>

<p>So weary was she and so intent on getting
through in what she called &ldquo;schedule time,&rdquo; that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
she almost ran into Professor Edwin Green before
she even recognized him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I beg your pardon,&rdquo; she exclaimed, a
wave of color sweeping over her pale face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you hurrying so fast on Saturday?&rdquo;
he asked pleasantly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you ever give yourself
a holiday?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; lots of them,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m
a little rushed to-day with some extra duties.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She thought of the &ldquo;cloud-bursts,&rdquo; which must
be made and packed in boxes by the afternoon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are overdoing it, Miss Brown. You
are not obeying the doctor&rsquo;s orders. When I see
you there to-night I shall confront you in his
presence with the charge of disobedience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There to-night?&rdquo; repeated Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly. Have you forgotten about the
supper to-night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not invited.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, you are,&rdquo; answered the Professor,
with a knowing smile. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll probably find the
note waiting for you. And you must be sure and
come, because the McLean&rsquo;s are real characters.
They will interest you, I am sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Nance,&rdquo; was Molly&rsquo;s first thought. And
her second thought was: &ldquo;If her mother is invited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
out to dine, she can accept.&rdquo; Her face
brightened at this, and without knowing it, she
smiled.</p>

<p>Molly led such a busy, concentrated life, that
when she did relax for a few moments, she
sometimes seemed absent-minded and inattentive.
The Professor was looking at her closely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are pleased at being asked to the McLean&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was thinking of something else,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;I was wondering if, after all, Nance couldn&rsquo;t
arrange to go. Of course, she&rsquo;ll be invited, too;
but, you see, her mother is to be here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Mrs. Oldham, the Suffragette, her mother?&rdquo;
he asked in surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Oldham is to dine at the President&rsquo;s
to-night. I know, because I was asked to meet
her, but&rdquo;&mdash;he looked at her very hard indeed&mdash;&ldquo;I
had another engagement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then Nance can go. Isn&rsquo;t it beautiful? I
am so glad!&rdquo; Molly clasped her hands joyously.</p>

<p>Professor Green gave her such a beautiful,
beaming smile that it fairly transfigured his
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a very good friend, Miss Brown,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
he said gently; &ldquo;but would not Miss Oldham
rather be with her mother, that is, in case the
President should invite her, too, which is highly
probable?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hope she won&rsquo;t. You see, Nance has
never had much pleasure with young people, and&rdquo;&mdash;it
was difficult to explain&mdash;&ldquo;and her mother&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
she hesitated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her mother, being the most famous clubwoman
in America, hasn&rsquo;t spent much time at
home? Is that it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, yes,&rdquo; admitted Molly. &ldquo;In fact, she
hardly remembers she has a daughter,&rdquo; she
added indignantly, and then bit her lip, feeling
that she was bordering on disloyalty.</p>

<p>The Professor cleared his throat and thrust
his hands into his pockets. He was really very
boyish-looking to be so old.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you have set your heart on Miss Oldham&rsquo;s
going to the supper to-night?&rdquo; he said gravely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If there is any fun going, Judy and I would
be sorry to have her miss it,&rdquo; she answered.
&ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t suppose it would be thrilling to
dine at the President&rsquo;s with a lot of learned older
people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just on my way to President Walker&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
now,&rdquo; pursued the Professor thoughtfully. &ldquo;In
fact, I was just about to deliver my regrets in
person regarding dinner to-night, and having
some business to attend to with Miss Walker, I
thought I would call. While I am there, it is
possible&mdash;well, in fact, Miss Brown, there should
be a good fairy provided by Providence to grant
all unselfish wishes. She would not be a busy
fairy by any means, I am afraid, except when
she hovered around you. Good morning,&rdquo; and
lifting his hat, the Professor hastened away,
leaving Molly in a state of half-pleased perplexity.</p>

<p>On the table in her room she found a note from
Mrs. McLean, inviting her to supper that evening.
Two other invitations from the same lady
were handed to Nance and Judy, but Nance was
at that moment seated at her desk accepting an
invitation from Miss Walker to dine there with
her mother at seven. She was writing the answer
very carefully and slowly, in her best handwriting,
and on her best monogram note paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think that&rsquo;s good enough?&rdquo; she demanded,
handing the note to Molly to read.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; answered Molly, looking it over
hastily while she prepared to write her own answer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
to Mrs. McLean, and then she threw herself
into the business of &ldquo;cloud-bursts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just as the lunch gong sounded, Bridget, the
Irish waitress at President Walker&rsquo;s house, appeared
at their half-open door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A note for Miss Oldham,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and the
President says no answer is necessary. Good
afternoon, ma&rsquo;am; they&rsquo;ll be waitin&rsquo; lunch if I
don&rsquo;t make haste.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Miss Oldham</span>,&rsquo;&rdquo; Nance read
aloud. &ldquo;&lsquo;I have just learned that you are invited
to a young people&rsquo;s supper party to-night at Mrs.
McLean&rsquo;s, and I therefore hasten to release you
from your engagement to dine with me. Your
mother will spare you, I am sure, on this one
evening, and I hope you will enjoy yourself with
your friends. With kindest regards, believe me,</p>

<p><span class="rght3">&ldquo;&lsquo;Cordially yours,</span><br />
<span class="rght1">&ldquo;&lsquo;Emma K. Walker.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span><br />
</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she a brick?&rdquo; cried Judy, dancing
around the room and clapping her hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was awfully nice of her,&rdquo; said Nance
thoughtfully. &ldquo;I wonder how she knew I was
invited to the McLean&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some good fairy must have told her,&rdquo; answered
Molly, half to herself, as she stirred
brown sugar into a saucepan.</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<br />

<small>THE MCLEAN SUPPER.</small></h2>


<p>Nance did get a telegram from her mother that
afternoon. It was very vague about trains and
merely said: &ldquo;Arrive in Wellington about two
this afternoon. Meet me. Mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fortunately, the girls were as familiar with
the train schedule as with their own class schedules,
and knew exactly what train she meant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the two-fifteen, of course,&rdquo; announced
Judy. &ldquo;Shall we go down with you to meet her,
Nance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes; I think mother would like that
very much,&rdquo; answered Nance, pleased with the
idea. &ldquo;She loves attention.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Therefore, when the two-fifteen pulled into
Wellington station, our three freshmen, together
with Margaret Wakefield heading a deputation
from the Freshman Suffrage Club, and Miss
Bowles, teacher in Higher Mathematics, were
waiting on the platform.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;There she is!&rdquo; cried Nance, with a note of
eagerness in her voice that made Molly&rsquo;s heart
ache.</p>

<p>They all moved forward to meet a gaunt,
tired-looking woman, with a sallow, faded complexion
and a nervous manner; but her brilliant,
clear brown eyes offset her unprepossessing appearance.
Glowing with intelligence and with
feverish energy they flashed their message to the
world, like two mariner&rsquo;s lights at sea, and those
who caught that burning glance forgot the tired
face and distraught manner of the woman of
clubs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are you, my dear?&rdquo; she said, kissing
Nance quite casually, without noticing where the
kiss was going to land, and scarcely glancing at
her daughter.</p>

<p>She had evidently been making notes on the
trip down and still carried a pencil and some
scrap paper in one hand, while the other grasped
her suit case, of which Nance promptly relieved
her. She shook hands cordially with Miss
Bowles, and the girls whom Nance introduced,
searching the face of each, as a recruiting officer
might examine applicants for the army.
Then they all climbed into the bus and presently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
she plunged into a discussion with Miss Bowles
on the advance of the suffrage movement in
England and America.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And this is the woman,&rdquo; whispered Judy to
Molly dramatically, &ldquo;who has spoken before legislatures
and represented the suffrage party
abroad and been regent of Colonial Dames and
President of National Societies for the Purification
of Politics and&mdash;and lecturer on &lsquo;The History
of Legislation&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How under the sun can you remember it all?&rdquo;
interrupted Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I have got them straight,&rdquo; answered
Judy, &ldquo;but they all sound alike, anyhow,
so what&rsquo;s the odds?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly discreetly took herself off to Judy&rsquo;s
room that afternoon, leaving Nance and her
mother together for the short time that elapsed
before the lecture was to begin. But Nance soon
followed them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother wants to be alone,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;She
has some notes to look over, and she has never
read her day-before-yesterday&rsquo;s mail yet. By
the way, you are not going to the lecture, are
you?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course we are,&rdquo; answered the girls in the
same breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the walk?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That can be postponed until to-morrow,&rdquo; answered
Molly promptly. &ldquo;The boys are going to
spend the night at the McLean&rsquo;s, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus Nance&rsquo;s happiness was all arranged for
by her two devoted friends.</p>

<p>The gymnasium was only half full when the
girls escorted &ldquo;the most distinguished clubwoman
in America&rdquo; across the campus and into
the great hall. The freshmen had turned out in
full force, partly to do honor to Nance and partly
because President Margaret Wakefield had been
talking up the lecture beforehand. Miss Walker
and others of the faculty were there, and in a
far gallery seat Molly caught a glimpse of Professor
Green, whose glance seemed to be turned
unseeingly in her direction.</p>

<p>If Judy and Molly had had any fears as to how
the absent-minded member of clubs was going
to conduct herself on the platform, all doubts
were soon dispelled. After the introduction
made by the President, the lecturer&rsquo;s nervous
manner entirely disappeared. She approached
the front of the platform with a composure marvelous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
to see, and in a cultivated, trained voice&mdash;not
her everyday voice, by any means&mdash;she delivered
an address of fervid and passionate eloquence;
a plea for woman&rsquo;s rights and universal
suffrage so convincing that the most obstinate
&ldquo;anti&rdquo; would have been won over. After the
lecture there was an impromptu reception on the
platform; then tea at Miss Bowles&rsquo; room and at
last home to dress for the supper parties.</p>

<p>Judy and Molly had hastened ahead, leaving
Nance to tear her mother from her circle of admirers
with the plea that she would be too late.
At twenty minutes before seven they hurried in,
Mrs. Oldham looking so frail and exhausted that
it hardly seemed possible she could keep up.
While her poor daughter dashed into her own
clothes, her mother sat limp and inert during the
process of having her hair beautifully arranged
with lightning speed by the deft and handy Judy,
while Molly gave the weary woman aromatic
spirits of ammonia in a glass of water and presently
hooked her into a dinner dress which was
really very handsome, of black lace over gray
satin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, my dears,&rdquo; she said amiably, giving
an absent-minded glance at herself in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
glass. &ldquo;You are very kind, I am sure. I am
such a busy woman I have little time to spare for
beautifying; but I must say Miss Kean has improved
my appearance by that high arrangement
of hair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were surprised that she remembered
Judy&rsquo;s name until they learned from Nance later
that such was her training in meeting strangers,
she never forgot a name or face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, where am I going?&rdquo; continued the famous
clubwoman. &ldquo;You will drop me there, you
say? You are going somewhere, Nance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, mother,&rdquo; answered Nance patiently. It
was the third time she had told her mother that
fact.</p>

<p>At last they got her be-nubiaed and be-caped,
and at exactly two minutes past seven o&rsquo;clock deposited
her at the President&rsquo;s front door.</p>

<p>Then, with feelings of indescribable relief,
they ran gayly across the campus, chattering and
laughing like magpies.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later they were seated at Mrs.
McLean&rsquo;s large round supper table.</p>

<p>Professor Green, seated just opposite Nance,
gave her happy, glowing face a long questioning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
look, then turning to Molly next to him, he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is enjoying it, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; whispered Molly; &ldquo;thanks to you, good
fairy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the wish must come before the fairy acts,
so that, after all, one is far more important than
the other,&rdquo; he replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t the lecture wonderful?&rdquo; asked Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very remarkable,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Women
like that should take to the platform and leave
families to other women to rear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They certainly can&rsquo;t do both,&rdquo; said Molly, remembering
poor Nance&rsquo;s outburst the afternoon
before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if you have the vote,&rdquo; went on the Professor
in a louder voice, and with a kind of mock
solemnity, &ldquo;what will you do with it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll pitch all the men out of office, Professor,&rdquo;
called Dr. McLean, who had overheard
this question; &ldquo;and they&rsquo;ll do all the work, too,
and we men will begin to enjoy life a little.
We&rsquo;ve been slaves long enough. I&rsquo;m for the
emancipation of men,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;and Woman&rsquo;s
Suffrage is the only way to bring it about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They all laughed at this original view of the
question, and Mrs. McLean, a charming woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
with a beautiful Scotch accent, impossible to
imitate, observed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear, the women are just as great slaves
as the men, and they work much harder, if only
you knew it. But you don&rsquo;t because we are careful
to conceal it. There are <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">vera</i> few women
who do not wear their company manners in the
presence of a man, take my word for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that the reason you are always so charming,
Mrs. McLean?&rdquo; put in Professor Green.
&ldquo;But I suspect you have only company manners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all, Professor; young Andy will tell
you that I can be rude enough at times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andy McLean, a tall, raw-boned youth with
sandy hair and a thin, intelligent face, was too
deeply engaged in conversation at that moment
with Nance, to hear his mother&rsquo;s speech.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let him alone, he&rsquo;s busy,&rdquo; remarked his father
with a humorous smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an old song we sing at home,&rdquo; went
on Mrs. McLean, &ldquo;&lsquo;there&rsquo;s nae luck in tha&rsquo; hoose
when the gude man&rsquo;s awa&rsquo;,&rsquo; but it should be
the gude wife, for if ever a house goes to sixes
and sevens it is my own house when I leave the
two Andys and take ship for Scotland for a bit
of a visit. There&rsquo;s nae luck in the hoose for certain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
and glad they are to get me back again, if
&rsquo;tis only for their own personal comfort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hoity, toity, mother,&rdquo; exclaimed the doctor;
&ldquo;we&rsquo;re joost as glad to have you for your ainsel&rsquo;,
my dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, is it so, then?&rdquo; laughed the gude wife.
&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s satisfying assurance, truly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They found the doctor and his wife very amusing,
and Molly liked Lawrence Upton, too, who
was seated on her other side. He was a typical
college youth, tall and stalwart, his brown hair
brushed back in a pompadour, his clear, ruddy
complexion glowing with vigor. In fact, he was
one of the leading athletes at Exmoor, and had
won a championship at high jumping and running.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope we&rsquo;ll have some dancing after dinner,
Miss Brown,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I hear Southern girls
fairly float, and I&rsquo;d like to have a chance to find
it out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll be disappointed with me,
then,&rdquo; answered Molly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been leading at
most of the college dances this fall, and it&rsquo;s
ruination to good dancing, you know. A leader
is always pulling against the bit like a badly
trained horse.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You look to me like a thoroughbred, Miss
Brown,&rdquo; said the gallant youth. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid
of your pulling against the bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There <em>was</em> some dancing after dinner in the
McLean&rsquo;s long, old-fashioned drawing-room,
while Mrs. McLean herself played long old-fashioned
waltzes on the piano, funny hop polkas
and schottisches of antique origin. They enjoyed
it immensely, however, fitting barn dances to the
schottisches and mazurkas and two steps to the
polkas. Twice Professor Green engaged Molly
in a waltz. She had anticipated that his dancing
would be as old-fashioned as the music, but
to her surprise, she found him thoroughly up to
date. In fact, she was obliged to admit that the
Professor in English Literature danced better
than any of the younger men at Mrs. McLean&rsquo;s
that night.</p>

<p>It was really the most delightful evening Molly
had spent since she had been at Wellington. To
Nance, it was the most delightful evening of her
entire life and Judy, who always enjoyed the
last time best of all, told Mrs. McLean when
they left that she had never had a better time
in her life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>After the dance, they sat around the big open
fire, roasting chestnuts, while Dr. McLean sang
a funny song called &ldquo;Wee Wullie,&rdquo; and Judy
followed with an absurd &ldquo;piece&rdquo; on the piano
called &ldquo;Birdie&rsquo;s Dead,&rdquo; in schottische time, which
sent them into shrieks of laughter and amused
Dr. McLean so that he laid his head on his wife&rsquo;s
shoulder and wept with joy.</p>

<p>Sitting in the inglenook by the fireplace, Professor
Green said to Molly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been waiting to say something to you,
Miss Brown, and I will ask you to regard it as
confidential.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked up thinking perhaps it was the
comic opera he was going to talk about, but she
was vastly mistaken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When, as Botticelli&rsquo;s Flora, you came to
that night with the words, &lsquo;I saw her&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; you
did not guess, did you, that I, too, had seen her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They looked at each other and a flash of understanding
passed between them. They now
shared two secrets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I always wanted to tell you,&rdquo; he continued
in a low voice, &ldquo;how much I admired your generous
silence. You are a very remarkable young
woman.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>With that the party broke up. Later, stretching
her long slenderness in the three-quarter bed
beside Judy, Molly smiled to herself, and decided
that some older men were almost as nice as some
young ones.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.<br />

<small>A MIDNIGHT ADVENTURE.</small></h2>


<p>Just about this time a new figure appeared at
Wellington College. She was known as &ldquo;inspector
of dormitories,&rdquo; and her office was mainly
sanitary, and did not infringe on the duties of
the matrons. The new inspector lodged at
Queen&rsquo;s, since there was an empty room in that
establishment, and her name was Miss Steel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If she had had her choice of all the names
in the English language, she could not have
chosen a more suitable one,&rdquo; remarked Judy who
had taken a violent dislike to Miss Steel from
the first.</p>

<p>She was indeed a steel-like person, steely eyes,
steel-gray hair, pale, thin lips, and at her belt
metallic chains from which jangled notebook and
pencil. When she spoke, which was rarely, her
voice was sharp and incisive, and cut the air like
a knife. But her most objectionable quality, the
girls thought, was that she never made any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
sound when she walked, the reason being that
she had rubber heels on her shoes.</p>

<p>The first real encounter the girls had with
Miss Steel was at a Thanksgiving Eve spread
given by the combined G.&nbsp;F. Society, most of
the members having received bountiful Thanksgiving
boxes from home. Nance&rsquo;s neglected and
lonely father had sent her a five-pound box of
candy in lieu of the usual box, which takes a
woman to plan and pack, and Judy&rsquo;s devoted parents,
always on the fly, had shipped her a box of
fruit. All the others had received regular boxes
full of Thanksgiving cheer, and the feast was to
be a grand one. Each member invited guests,
and by general vote extra ones were asked:
Frances Andrews, who declined because she was
going away, and two freshmen who lived in the
village, and were working their way through college.
Judith Blount was to be there by invitation
of pretty Jessie Lynch, and Molly had invited
Mary Stewart.</p>

<p>Most of the girls wore fancy costumes, and
Molly&rsquo;s and Nance&rsquo;s large room was the scene of
an extravaganza. The feast was piled on four
study tables placed in an unbroken row and covered
with a white cloth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>Jessie had worn her famous ballet costume,
and was as pretty as a little captive sprite. Judith
was in a gorgeous Turkish dress consisting
of full yellow silk trousers, a tunic of transparent
net and embroidered Turkish slippers. Nance
wore her Scotch costume, and at the last minute
Molly, who had been too busy even to think of a
costume all day, dressed herself up charmingly
like a Tyrolean peasant in what she could collect
from the other girls.</p>

<p>A great many of the guests had arrived and
the room was filled when a chambermaid appeared
in the doorway with a tray of cards.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some gentlemen to call, Miss,&rdquo; she said, endeavoring
not to smile at a Little Boy Blue and
a Little Lord Fauntleroy, who were waltzing together.</p>

<p>There were four cards on the tray: &ldquo;Mr. Edwin
Green,&rdquo; &ldquo;Mr. George Theodore Green,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Andrew McLean, 2d,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mr. Lawrence Upton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, of all the strange times to pay a call,&rdquo;
exclaimed Molly. &ldquo;Will you say that we are
very sorry, but we must be excused this evening,&rdquo;
she said to the maid.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>The servant bowed and slipped away, while all
the girls in the room pounced on the cards.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I never! Four beaux, and one of them
a professor!&rdquo; cried Jessie, showing the cards to
Judith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Brown could hardly claim Cousin Edwin
as a beau,&rdquo; said Judith, her black eyes snapping.
&ldquo;His younger brother, George, often
drags him into things, and poor Cousin Edwin
consents to go because George is so timid, but
as for paying a social call on a freshman, even
the most self-confident freshman could hardly
regard a visit from him as that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t regard it as that,&rdquo; ejaculated Molly.</p>

<p>She was not accustomed to sharp-tongued people,
and it was really difficult for her to deal
with them properly, as Judy could, and Nance,
too. But she forced herself to remember that
Judith was a guest in her room, and was about to
partake of some of her good Kentucky fare.
She turned away without saying another word,
and fortunately the maid came back just then
and relieved the strained situation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gentlemen say they must see you,
ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and if you won&rsquo;t come down
to them, they&rsquo;ll just come upstairs.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried a chorus of girls.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a wild scramble on the
stairs; shouts of laughter, a sound of heavy boots
thumping along the hall, and four tall young men
burst into the room. There were shrieks from
disappearing Boy Blues and Fauntleroys, who
endeavored to cover their extremities with sofa
cushions, the captive sprite rushed into a closet
and a wild scene of disorder and pandemonium
followed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened, ladies,&rdquo; said the tallest
young man, who wore correct evening clothes,
from his opera hat and pearl studs to his pointed
patent leather pumps. His hair was light and
curly, and he had a long yellow mustache, like
Lord Dundreary&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ladies! ladies! why all this excitement?&rdquo;
called another of the quartette, dressed in full
black and white checked trousers, a short tan
overcoat, a red tie and a brown derby.</p>

<p>The third young man wore a smoking jacket
and white duck trousers, and the fourth was
dressed in an English golf suit and visored cap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you villains!&rdquo; cried Jessica, popping her
head out of the closet. &ldquo;You have frightened us
almost to death. Do you think I wouldn&rsquo;t know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
you, Margaret Wakefield, even in that sporting
suit. Come over here and show yourself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bogus gentlemen were indeed three of the
evening&rsquo;s hostesses and one of the guests. Mary
Stewart wore the evening clothes, borrowed from
her brother for a senior play to take place shortly.
Judy had on the golf suit, Sallie Marks the dinner
coat and Margaret the rakish sporting costume.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where did you get the cards?&rdquo; asked Judith,
ashamed of herself, now that the visitors&rsquo;
real identity was disclosed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wrote to Dodo and asked him for them,&rdquo;
answered Judy, giving her a look, as much as to
say, &ldquo;What affair is it of yours?&rdquo;</p>

<p>After the banquet was commenced and the fun
waxed fast and furious, there was a cakewalk at
the last, with a box of &ldquo;cloud-bursts&rdquo; as the
prize, the eight hostesses taking turns as judges.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After this wild orgy, I think we&rsquo;d better be
leaving,&rdquo; said Mary Stewart. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting cold
and late, but we&rsquo;ve had a glorious time. Will
you permit a gentleman to kiss you on the cheek,
Molly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I will,&rdquo; answered Molly, &ldquo;and proud of
the honor.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>Slipping on a skirt and a long ulster, Mary
took her departure with Judith and the other
girls, who did not have rooms at Queen&rsquo;s, and
pretty soon the party had disbanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay and help you gather up the loaves
and fishes,&rdquo; Judy announced. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll soon be ten,
but we can hang a dressing gown over the transom
and draw the blinds and no one will know
the difference just this once,&rdquo; she added, proceeding
to carry out her ideas of deception.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still hungry,&rdquo; observed Nance. &ldquo;I had
to wait on so many people I didn&rsquo;t have a chance
to eat any supper myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So am I famished,&rdquo; said Molly; &ldquo;but I was
ashamed to confess it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like a cup of hot tea,&rdquo; observed Judy, who
had waited on nobody but herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When Mrs. Markham comes around,&rdquo; cautioned
Nance, &ldquo;in case she knocks on the door,
one of us be ready to put out the light. Judy,
you slip into the closet. She&rsquo;s been known to
come in, you know, after one of these jamborees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Markham&rsquo;s away,&rdquo; answered Judy.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Steel beads&rsquo; is taking her place until after
Thanksgiving.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>The girls munched their sandwiches and
talked in low voices. Suddenly there was a sharp
rap on the door. Instantly the light went out
and there was dead silence. Judy, crawling on
all fours toward the closet, was about to conceal
herself behind protecting skirts, when the rap
was repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what is it?&rdquo; called Nance, the boldest
among them, &ldquo;the light is out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no answer and the rap was not repeated.</p>

<p>The girls waited a few moments, and then cautiously
lighting a student&rsquo;s lamp with a green
shade, proceeded with their supper. Judy looked
at her watch. It was a quarter of eleven.</p>

<p>Again they were interrupted. This time by
some pebbles thrown against the window.</p>

<p>Molly raised the sash softly and gazed down
into the darkness below.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she called.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Margaret,&rdquo; answered a voice from the
yard. &ldquo;For the love of heaven, can&rsquo;t you let me
in? I&rsquo;ll explain afterward. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind
ringing up Mrs. Markham, but I&rsquo;m afraid of that
Steel woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; answered Molly, and closing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
the window, she turned to consult with the
others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to be done but to go down,&rdquo;
they decided, and Molly insisted on being the
sacrificial lamb. Judy made her slip on her
nightgown over her dress, and her dressing gown
over that, in order to appear in the proper guise
in case anything happened.</p>

<p>But they were doomed to another shock that
night.</p>

<p>Just as Molly opened the door she came face
to face with Miss Steel standing outside in the
hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said Molly politely,
feeling thankful she had put on her nightgown,
&ldquo;I thought I heard a noise outside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You seem to be sitting up very late to-night,
Miss Brown,&rdquo; said Miss Steel, looking at her
coldly. &ldquo;I was told to enforce the ten o&rsquo;clock
rule in Mrs. Markham&rsquo;s absence, and I must ask
you to get to bed at once, unless you wish to be
reported.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; said Molly.</p>

<p>The woman seemed unnecessarily stern, she
thought, because, after all, this was not a boarding
school, but a college. However, she went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
back, and closed and bolted the door. In her
heart she felt a contempt for any one who would
creep about and listen at people&rsquo;s doors. Mrs.
Markham would have been incapable of it.</p>

<p>Just then there came another pebble against
the window.</p>

<p>Judy crept to the window this time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait, Margaret,&rdquo; she called. &ldquo;Miss Steel is
about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was perfect stillness for several long
black minutes. The three girls sat in a row
on the floor listening with strained ears and to
Judy at least the adventure was not without its
enjoyment. At last they felt that it might be
safe to act. Taking off their shoes they moved
noiselessly to the window and looked down.
There stood the courageous Margaret in full
view on the roof of the piazza. She had actually
shinned up one of the pillars, which was not such
a difficult feat as it might seem, as the railing
around the piazza had placed her within reach
of the wooden grillwork and swinging onto that
she had drawn herself up to the roof. She had
skinned her wrist and stumped one of her stockinged
toes, having removed her shoes and hidden
them under the house, but she appeared now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
the very figure of courage and action, waiting
for the next move. The three girls stood looking
down at her in a state of fearful uncertainty
as to what should be done next, and as if this
were not exciting enough, three light telegraphic
taps were heard on the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not Miss Steel,&rdquo; whispered Judy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is it,&rdquo; she called softly through the keyhole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jessie,&rdquo; came the answer.</p>

<p>Instantly the door was opened and Jessie crept
in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Steel is up,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I saw her
on the landing below just now. Be careful. I
am scared to death because Margaret hasn&rsquo;t come
back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For an answer, they led her to the window
and pointed to the shadowy figure of her roommate
on the piazza roof.</p>

<p>Because Molly had conceived a dislike and distrust
for Miss Steel, she made up her mind to
outwit her and save her friend. She reflected
that if Margaret tried any of the girls on the second
floor whose windows opened on the roof, she
might get in but she would still have the third
flight to make and as the stairs creaked at every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
step, it would be a difficult matter. Fortunately
Miss Steel&rsquo;s room was on the other side of the
hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a scheme,&rdquo; she whispered at last.
&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t any one move. I can manage it
without making a sound.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a ball of twine on the mantelpiece.
Thank heavens for that. She tied one end to the
back of a cane chair, which she let slowly out of
the window. Then, snipping off the end of the
cord, she gave it to Nance to hold. Another
chair, which was fortunately smaller, she let
down in the same way and finally a stool. Margaret
placed one on top of the other, mounted
the precarious and toppling pyramid, and with
the strength of arm and wrist which showed her
gymnasium training, pulled herself to the window
sill and was in the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be quiet,&rdquo; they whispered. &ldquo;Miss Steel is
about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The four girls lay down on the couches and
waited a long time. Judy really fell asleep in
the interval before they dared risk pulling back
the chairs. It was, in fact, a risky business, and
had to be done cautiously and carefully to keep
them from bumping against the walls of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
house. At last, however, the whole thing was
accomplished.</p>

<p>Margaret explained that she had gone over to
one of the other houses to return the clothes
she had borrowed and had joined another
Thanksgiving party and stayed longer than she
had intended. They also had been held up by
the matron, and had been obliged to put out the
lights and hide everything under the bed. She
had escaped from the house by a miracle without
being found out, and had trusted to luck and her
friends for getting into Queen&rsquo;s unobserved.</p>

<p>And now, at last, the adventure was almost
over. After another interminable wait, Judy
and Margaret and Jessie crept off to their rooms.</p>

<p>Judy&rsquo;s door was still ajar when she saw a
flash of light on the stairs, which heralded the
approach of Miss Steel, still fully clothed, and
walking noiselessly as usual. Judy closed her
door and locked it softly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only a spy would wear felt slippers,&rdquo; she
said to herself scornfully. Then she laughed.
&ldquo;It was rather good fun to be sure, but would it
have mattered so much, after all, if Margaret
had boldly come in at the front door and explained?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>They would never have gone to all that trouble
to deceive nice Mrs. Markham, her thoughts
continued as she removed her manly attire, but
Miss Steel was different.</p>

<p>As for Molly, her thoughts were about the
same as Judy&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A lady doesn&rsquo;t creep,&rdquo; she was thinking, as
she thankfully crawled into bed; &ldquo;a lady doesn&rsquo;t
listen at doors or wear soundless slippers in order
to walk like a cat. No, Miss Steel is decidedly
not a lady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And when Molly came to this decision about
a person, she avoided them carefully ever afterward.
Her definition of a &ldquo;lady&rdquo; was about
the same as a man&rsquo;s definition of a &ldquo;gentleman.&rdquo;
It had nothing whatever to do with birth or education.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />

<small>THE FOOTBALL GAME</small></h2>


<p>During those fast flying weeks which tread on
one another&rsquo;s heels so rapidly between Thanksgiving
and Christmas, came one of the most important
events of the season.</p>

<p>It was announced on the bulletin board as the
&ldquo;Harboard-Snail Football Game,&rdquo; and was, in
fact, a grand burlesque on a game played not
long before between two university teams.</p>

<p>Quite half of the Wellington students took
part in the affair and those who were not actively
engaged were placed in the cheer sections to yell
themselves hoarse. There were a dozen doctors,
an ambulance, stretcher bearers, trained nurses
and the two teams in proper football attire.</p>

<p>Everybody in college turned out one Saturday
afternoon to witness this elaborate parody. A
coach drove over from Exmoor fairly alive with
students, and the fields outside the Wellington
athletic grounds were black with people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>Judy was a member of the corps of physicians
who were all dressed alike in frock coats reaching
well below the knees, gray trousers and silk
hats. They had imposing mustaches, carried
bags of instruments and were the most ludicrous
of all the actors that day.</p>

<p>But it was the stretcher bearers who seemed to
excite the greatest merriment in the grand parade
which took place before the game began.
They were dressed something like &ldquo;Slivers,&rdquo; the
famous clown, in full white pantaloons and long
white coats cut in at the waist with wide skirts.
The members of the cheering sections which
headed the grand column were dressed in every
sort of absurd burlesque of a college boy&rsquo;s
clothes that could be devised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How they ever collected all those ridiculous
costumes is a marvel to me,&rdquo; exclaimed President
Walker to Dr. McLean, whose face had
turned an apoplectic purple from laughter and
who occasionally let out a roar of joy that could
be heard all the way across the field.</p>

<p>Following the cheering sections in the parade
were the two teams, hardly recognizable at all
as human beings. Their wigs of tousled hair
stood out all over their heads like the petals of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
enormous chrysanthemums. Most of them wore
nose guards or their faces were made up in a
savage and barbaric fashion. In their wadded
football suits, stuffed out of all human recognition,
they resembled trussed fowls. In the vanguard
of this strange and ludicrous procession
stalked a gigantic figure of Liberty. She was
about fifteen feet high, and her draperies reached
to the ground. Her long red hair blew in the
breezes and she carried a Wellington banner,
which she majestically waved over the heads of
the multitude. By her side ran a dwarf. They
were the mascots of the two sides.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, if that isn&rsquo;t our little friend, Miss
Molly Brown,&rdquo; exclaimed Dr. McLean, pointing
to Liberty. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a bonnie lass and a sweet one.
Think now, of her being able to walk on those
sticks without losing her balance. It&rsquo;s a verra
great achievement, I&rsquo;m thinking, for a giddy-headed
young woman. For they&rsquo;re all giddy-headed
at seventeen or thereabouts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was indeed Molly, the only girl in all Wellington
who could walk on stilts. The seniors
had advertised in <cite>The Commune</cite> for a first-class
&ldquo;stiltswoman,&rdquo; and Molly had promptly offered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
her services. Jessie had been selected as the
dwarf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope the child won&rsquo;t fall and break her
neck,&rdquo; said Mrs. McLean on the other side of the
doctor. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s verra dangerous. Suppose she
should become suddenly faint&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t suppose anything of the sort, mither.
You&rsquo;ve no grounds for thinkin&rsquo; the lass will tumble.
She seems to be at home in the air.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Professor Green, just beyond Mrs. McLean,
frowned, and put his hands in his pockets. He
wondered if Dr. McLean had forgotten that he
had been sent for just three weeks before when
Molly had fainted in the gymnasium, and the
Professor breathed a sigh of relief when Liberty
presently descended to the earth and the
game began.</p>

<p>It was one of the bloodiest and roughest games
in the history of football. The ambulance bell
rang constantly. Every time a victim fell, the
cheering section on the other side set up a wild
yell. Doctors and nurses were scattered all about
the edges of the field attending to the wounded
and the stretchers were busy every minute. As
fast as one man tumbled another jumped into
his place, and at last when there came a touchdown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
the players seemed to have fallen on top of
each other in a mad squirming mass.</p>

<p>People laughed that day who were rarely seen
to smile. Even Miss Steel&rsquo;s severe expression
relaxed into a cold, steely smile.</p>

<p>Molly had gathered up her long cheesecloth
robe and was sitting with Jessie on a bench at
the side of the field.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it perfect, Jessie?&rdquo; she was saying. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t think I ever enjoyed anything so much in
all my life. It will make a wonderful letter
home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jessie smiled absently. With a pair of field
glasses, she was searching the faces of the spectators
for two friends (men, of course), who
had motored over to see the sport. At her belt
was pinned the most enormous bunch of violets
ever seen. In fact, they were two bunches worn
as one, from her two admirers. Presently Judith
joined them on the bench. Ever since the
Thanksgiving spread she had endeavored to be
very nice to Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, Ju-ju!&rdquo; called Jessie; &ldquo;you are a sight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I feel that I am a disgrace
to the sex. I only hope I&rsquo;m not recognizable.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Your shiny black eye is the only familiar
thing about you. The rest is entirely disguised.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;d recognize that ring, Miss Blount,&rdquo;
put in Molly. &ldquo;Almost everybody knows that
emerald by sight now, who knows you at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judith glanced quickly at her finger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;I forgot I
was wearing it? How stupid of me! I am
booked to take Rosamond&rsquo;s place in a minute.
Will one of you girls take care of it for me? I
shall be much obliged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better take it, Jessie,&rdquo; said Molly, looking
rather doubtfully at the ring. She had only
one piece of jewelry to her name, a string of sapphires,
which had belonged to her mother when
she was a girl.</p>

<p>But the ring was too big for Jessie&rsquo;s slender,
pretty little fingers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;unless I wear it on my
thumb, and it might slip off, you know. You&rsquo;ll
have to take it, Molly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly slipped it on her finger and held it up
for admiration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the most beautiful ring I ever saw,&rdquo; she
exclaimed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the color of deep green sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
water. Not that I ever saw any, but I&rsquo;ve heard
tell of it,&rdquo; she added, laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say you have never seen
the ocean!&rdquo; cried Judith in a pleasant tone of
voice.</p>

<p>Molly had never seen her so amiable before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the freshman, &ldquo;this is the nearest
I have ever been to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, thanks for taking care of my ring,&rdquo;
went on Judith. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you after the game,&rdquo;
and she departed to take up her duties on the
field, just as Rosamond, at the appointed time,
with a gash across her face, made with
finger-nail salve, was borne from the field on a
stretcher.</p>

<p>After the game came another grand procession
in which all the wounded took part, Molly
on stilts, with Jessie running beside her, as before.</p>

<p>All that morning Molly had felt buoyed up by
the fun and excitement of the great burlesque.
But, now that the game was over, as she strode
along on the giant stilts, she began to feel the
same overpowering fatigue she had experienced
that night at the living picture show. For a
week she had been living on her nerves. Often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
at night she had not slept, but had tossed about
on her bed trying to recall her lessons or make
mental notes of things she intended to do. On
cold mornings, her feet and hands were numb
and dead and Judy often made her run across
the campus and back to start her circulation.
And now that numbness began to climb from
her toes straight up her body. Molly turned unsteadily
and with shaky strides at least six feet
long, hastened across the field. Her feeling that
she must get out of the noise and turmoil, away
from everybody in the world, carried her back
of a row of sheds under which the players sat
during the intermissions. Once in this quiet place
she let herself down from the stilts. She was
conscious of being very cold. There was a deep
red light in the western sky from the setting sun,
then the numbness reached her brain and she remembered
nothing more until she opened her eyes
and saw Dr. McLean at one side of her and
Professor Green at the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here she comes back at last,&rdquo; exclaimed the
doctor. &ldquo;Aye, lass, it&rsquo;s a good thing this young
man has an observant eye. Otherwise ye might
have been lying out here in the cold all night.
You feel better now, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, doctor,&rdquo; answered Molly weakly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like these fainting spells, my lass.
You&rsquo;re not made of iron, child. You&rsquo;ll have to
give up one thing or t&rsquo;other&mdash;study or play.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But there were other things Molly did beside
studying and playing. Of course the doctor did
not know about the &ldquo;cloud-bursts&rdquo; and the shoe-blacking
and the tutoring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye, here comes one of my associates with a
carriage,&rdquo; he went on, chuckling to himself.
&ldquo;Shall we have a consultation now, Dr. Kean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy, still in her absurd burlesque costume,
had driven up in one of the village surreys.</p>

<p>As the two men lifted Molly into the back seat,
she noticed for the first time that she was wearing
a man&rsquo;s overcoat. It was dark blue and felt
warm and comfortable. She slipped her hands
into the deep pockets and snuggled down into its
folds. Certainly she felt shivery about the spine,
and her hands and feet, which were never known
to be warm, were now like lumps of ice. As
the doctor was still wearing his great coat of
Scotch tweed, it was evidently the coat of the
Professor of English Literature she had appropriated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s awfully good of you to lend me your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
coat,&rdquo; she said to Professor Green, who was
standing at the side of the carriage while the
doctor climbed in beside her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll
take cold without it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; he said, almost gruffly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
dressed in cheesecloth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I have on a white sweater under all this,&rdquo;
said Molly timidly.</p>

<p>The carriage drove away, however, without
his saying another word, and later that afternoon,
after Molly had taken a nap and felt rested
and refreshed, she engaged one of the maids at
Queen&rsquo;s cottage to return Professor Green&rsquo;s
overcoat with a message of thanks. Then, with
a sigh of relief, because when she had borrowed
anything it always weighed heavily on her mind,
and because she felt somehow that the Professor
was provoked with her, she turned over and went
to sleep again.</p>

<p>Just as the clock in the chapel tower sounded
midnight she sat up in bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, Molly, dear?&rdquo; asked Nance, who
was wakeful and uneasy about her friend.</p>

<p>Molly was looking at her right hand wildly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ring!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Judith&rsquo;s emerald ring&mdash;it&rsquo;s
gone!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>The ring was indeed gone. Neither of her
friends had seen it on her finger since she had
been in her room.</p>

<p>It was gone&mdash;lost!</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must have slipped off my finger when I
fainted,&rdquo; sobbed the poor girl.</p>

<p>Nance had summoned Judy at this trying
crisis, and the two girls endeavored to comfort
their friend, who seemed to be working herself
into a state of feverish excitement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind, we&rsquo;ll find it in the morning,
Molly,&rdquo; cried Nance. &ldquo;You know exactly where
it was you fell, don&rsquo;t you? Somewhere behind
the sheds. It&rsquo;s sure to be there. Judy and I
promise to go there first thing, don&rsquo;t we, Judy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; acquiesced Judy, who loved her
morning sleep better than anything in life. But
Judy was learning unselfishness since she had
been associating with Molly and Nance.</p>

<p>There was no more sleep for poor Molly that
night, however, and she lay through the dragging
hours with strained nerves and throbbing
temples wondering what would happen if she did
not find the ring.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.<br />

<small>THREE FRIENDS.</small></h2>


<p>Nance was still sound asleep when Molly crept
from her bed and dressed herself. It was a dismal
cold morning. A fine snow was falling and
she shivered as she tied a scarf around her head,
threw her long gray eiderdown cape over her
shoulders and slipped from the room, without
waking her friend, who was weary after the excitements
of the day before.</p>

<p>Across the wind-swept campus she hastened,
anxiety lending swiftness to her steps, and at last
reached the Athletic Field. At the far end
snuggled several low wooden sheds like a group
of animals trying to keep warm by staying close
together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must hurry,&rdquo; Molly thought, &ldquo;or the snow
will be so thick I shall never be able to find the
ring,&rdquo; and summoning all her energy she ran as
fast as she could straight to the spot where she
remembered to have dropped the day before behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
the sheds. Breathless and tingling all over
with little prickly chills, she knelt down and began
to search in the dead grass, brushing the
snow away as she hunted. She had not stopped
to find gloves, neither had she wasted any time
lacing her boots, but had slipped on some pumps
at the side of the bed.</p>

<p>For a long time Molly searched every inch
of the ground back of the sheds where she might
have been. Then, with an ever-growing feeling
of desperation, she hunted in the field itself,
across which she had followed the parade. And
it was here that Judy and Nance found her so
absorbed in her search that she had not even noticed
their approach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Molly, Molly! what are we going to do
with you?&rdquo; cried Nance, seizing her by the arm
impulsively. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll kill yourself by your imprudence.
Why didn&rsquo;t you wait and let us look?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly opened her mouth to answer, and the
words came out in a husky whisper. She had entirely
lost her voice from hoarseness, without
even knowing that she had caught cold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve looked everywhere,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;and
I haven&rsquo;t found it. I couldn&rsquo;t have lost it while
I was on the stilts, because I never let go of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
for a moment. It must have been when I
fainted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Judy, you take her home while I look again,&rdquo;
volunteered Nance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take her to the infirmary, you mean,&rdquo; answered
Judy, and she promptly led Molly by a
short cut toward the last house on the far side
of the campus, where stood the small college
hospital.</p>

<p>Molly obediently allowed herself to be piloted
along. Her cheeks were burning; there was a
feverish light in her eyes, and she no longer felt
cold at all, but hot all over with little chills along
her spine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m a great nuisance, Judy, dear.
I hope you&rsquo;ll forgive me, but I&rsquo;m really in great
trouble,&rdquo; she said huskily, as Judy confided her
to one of the two nurses at the hospital.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; was Judy&rsquo;s parting command.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find the ring. It can&rsquo;t possibly be lost
utterly. It&rsquo;s too big and green. I&rsquo;ll see Judith
Blount, too. Some one may have found it and
returned it to her by this time. I&rsquo;ll leave a notice
on the bulletin board and stand my little St. Joseph
on his head,&rdquo; she added laughing. &ldquo;You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
may be sure I&rsquo;ll leave nothing undone to find
that old ring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The first thing Judy did after breakfast that
Sunday morning was to pay a visit to Judith
Blount. There was a placard on her door announcing
to whom it might concern that Judith
was busy and did not wish to be disturbed, but
Judy knocked boldly and at an impatient &ldquo;Who
is it?&rdquo; replied: &ldquo;I wish to see you on important
business. Please unlock the door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy couldn&rsquo;t make out why Judith Blount
looked so white and uneasy when she entered the
room; nor why her expression changed to one
of intense relief a moment later.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came to ask you,&rdquo; began Judy abruptly, &ldquo;if
any one had found your emerald ring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Brown has my ring,&rdquo; answered Judith
promptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you know that Molly had fainted and
is now ill in the hospital and the ring is lost?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My emerald ring lost?&rdquo; Judith almost
shouted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t carry on so about it,&rdquo; put in Judy.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be found. Molly herself was up at dawn
this morning. She stole away before anybody
could stop her, and went to the field to look for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
it, but she hasn&rsquo;t been able to find it, and neither
has Nance, who looked for it later. Nance has
gone down to the village to find the surrey that
took Molly home. We are all doing everything
we can and in the meantime I thought I would
tell you so that you could help us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy could be very impudent when she wanted
to, and she was impudent now, as she stood
looking straight into Judith&rsquo;s angry black eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She should have been more careful,&rdquo; burst
out Judith in a rage. &ldquo;How do I know that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
she stopped, frightened at what she was
about to say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better not say that,&rdquo; said Judy calmly. &ldquo;It
simply wouldn&rsquo;t go, you know, and you must
know as well as I do that it would be absolutely
false.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know what I was going to say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could guess,&rdquo; said Judy, shrugging her
shoulders. &ldquo;I can often guess things you would
like to say, but don&rsquo;t, Miss Blount. What I came
for was to ask you to help us find the ring.
Molly is very ill, and, of course, it&rsquo;s the loss of
the ring as much as anything else that&rsquo;s made
her so. We&rsquo;re all doing the best we can, and if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
you&rsquo;ll just kindly add your efforts to ours, it
might help some.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Supposing the ring isn&rsquo;t found, what redress
have I? It&rsquo;s been in our family for generations.
It was brought over from France by a Huguenot
ancestor&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nice place to be wearing it, then, at a football
game!&rdquo; exclaimed Judy indignantly. &ldquo;And then
forcing other people to take charge of it for you!
Redress, indeed! Do you want Molly to pay
you for your ring? I tell you, Miss Blount, that
a person who really had Huguenot ancestors
would never have suggested such a thing. It
wouldn&rsquo;t have been Huguenot etiquette.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Judy flung herself out of the room and
down the steps before the astonished Judith had
time to realize that she had been insulted by an
upstart of a freshman.</p>

<p>It looked very much for a day or two as if
Molly were going to have a congestion in one
lung. For several days she was a very sick girl.
She had a strange delirium that she was looking
for something while she was walking on stilts.
Many times she asked the nurse if sapphires were
as valuable as emeralds, and once she demanded
to know if an emerald as large as her little finger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
nail was worth much money, say, two acres of
good orchard land. But the lung was not congested,
as Dr. McLean had at first thought. In
a day or two the fever subsided and by Thursday
she was able to sit up in bed, propped by
many pillows and see Judy and Nance.</p>

<p>Her room was a bower of flowers. They had
even come from Exmoor, Lawrence Upton having
sent her a box of lovely pink roses. Mrs.
McLean had brought her a bunch of red berries
from the woods, and one day two cards were
brought up, one of which looked familiar: Miss
Grace Green and Mr. Edwin Green, inquiring
as to the improvement in Miss Molly Brown&rsquo;s
condition, were pleased to hear that she was better.</p>

<p>And now Nance and Judy sat on either side
the young invalid, each trying to assume a cheerful
expression and each feeling that whatever
disagreeable things had happened&mdash;and several
had happened&mdash;they must be hidden from Molly
at all costs.</p>

<p>Judith Blount had scattered reports around
college of an extremely hateful character which
Molly&rsquo;s friends had done their best to suppress.
The ring had never been found, although everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
had been done that could be thought of in
the way of advertising and searching.</p>

<p>Moreover, Miss Steel had asked twice of
Molly&rsquo;s condition in a very meaning tone of
voice, and had wished to know exactly when the
nurse thought Molly would be able to see visitors.
These things the girls knew, and since Molly
was still weak and very hoarse, her friends were
careful to keep off dangerous subjects.</p>

<p>Strange to say, Molly had never mentioned the
ring to any one since she had been in the hospital.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everybody has been so beautifully kind,&rdquo; she
was saying, &ldquo;and really, I think the rest is going
to do me so much good, that when I get well
I&rsquo;ll be better than I was before I got sick,&rdquo; she
added, laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve missed you terribly,&rdquo; said Nance
dolefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Queen&rsquo;s just a dead old hole without you,
Molly, dear,&rdquo; went on Judy affectionately.</p>

<p>Molly smiled lovingly at her two friends.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are the dearest&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she began, taking a
hand of each when the nurse entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Stewart would like to see you, Miss
Brown.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; cried Molly; &ldquo;do ask her to come
up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nance and Judy did not linger after Mary
Stewart&rsquo;s arrival. Her face also wore a serious
look, and she took Molly&rsquo;s hand and gazed down
into her face almost with a compassionate expression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are you, Molly, dear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m much better,&rdquo; replied Molly, cheerfully.
&ldquo;I shall be up by to-morrow, the doctor
says, and I expect to go back to Queen&rsquo;s Sunday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary sat down and drew her chair up close
to the little white bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost providential my being in the hospital
like this,&rdquo; went on Molly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s rested me so.
You see, I was terribly worried about something
when I came here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you aren&rsquo;t worried any longer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; I&rsquo;ve conquered it. I know it&rsquo;s got to be
faced; but I believe there will be a way out of it,
and I&rsquo;m not frightened any more. I have always
had a kind of blind faith like that when things
look very black.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are talking of the emerald ring, aren&rsquo;t
you, Molly?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mary. I know it hasn&rsquo;t been found, of
course. I can tell that by the girls&rsquo; faces, and I
know that Judith Blount is&mdash;well, she is your
friend, Mary&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no; not now,&rdquo; put in Mary. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had
a&mdash;er&mdash;difference of opinion that has&mdash;well, not
to put too fine a point on it, broken up our friendship.
I always admired her, without ever really
liking her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly looked at Mary and a very tender expression
came into her heavenly blue eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was the difference about me?&rdquo; she asked
presently.</p>

<p>Mary hesitated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Molly; since you force me to tell you, it
was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has been saying some horrid things? Of
course, I knew she would. I was prepared for
that. And I could tell&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Molly paused. &ldquo;No,
no, I mustn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she exclaimed hastily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What could you tell, Molly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me. I would never speak to myself
again, if I did tell. She has been saying that
I never lost the ring, that I was poor and needed
the money, and things like that. Tell me honestly,
isn&rsquo;t that the truth?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>Mary nodded her head and frowned. There
was a silence, and presently Mary&rsquo;s strong,
brown fingers closed over Molly&rsquo;s slender ones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Molly,&rdquo; she began in a business-like tone of
voice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost glad that this subject has
come up because I came here really to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she
broke off. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very hard,&rdquo; she began again.
&ldquo;I hardly know how to put it. You knew, Molly,
dear, that I was rich, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes; I guessed you must be, although
you have been careful not to mention it yourself.
You&rsquo;re the most high-bred, finest girl I ever
knew, Mary,&rdquo; she added impetuously.</p>

<p>Mary laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nice of you to say such things, dear,
because I haven&rsquo;t but one ancestor on my paternal
side and that&rsquo;s father, but he&rsquo;s generations
in himself, he&rsquo;s so splendid. But to go on, Molly,
dear, I am rich, not ordinarily rich, but enormously,
vastly rich. It&rsquo;s absurd, really, because
we&rsquo;ll never spend it, and we don&rsquo;t care a rap
about saving it; but whatever father touches just
turns to gold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish he&rsquo;d touch something for me,&rdquo; laughed
Molly, wistfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, listen to me, dear, and don&rsquo;t interrupt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
Father adores me to that extent that I could
spend any amount of money and he would just
smile and say: &lsquo;Go ahead, little Mary, go as far
as you like.&rsquo; But, you see, I only want a few
very nice things, consequently, I can&rsquo;t be extravagant
to save my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly laughed aloud at this naïve confession.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The point I&rsquo;m coming to is this, Molly: Judith
Blount is being exceedingly horrid over that
ring. I believe myself it will be found eventually.
But until it is found, I want you&mdash;now don&rsquo;t interrupt
me and don&rsquo;t carry on, please&mdash;I want
you to ask her the value of her old ring and give
her the money for it. If she chooses to be ill-bred,
she must be treated with ill-bred methods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, dearest Mary, I can&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began
Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you can. I haven&rsquo;t known you but a few
months, Molly, but I&rsquo;ve learned to love you in
that time. And when I really care for any one,
which is seldom, she becomes a sister to me. You
are my little sister, and shall always be. I shall
never change. And between sisters there must
be no foolish pride. Now, Molly, I want to settle
this thing with Judith Blount once and for all,
through you, of course. She is not to know I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
had anything to do with it. You must tell her
that you have raised the money and would like
to pay her the full value of the ring. When the
ring is found, she can give you back the money.
That will stop her wicked, wagging tongue, at
least.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly tried hard not to cry, but the tears welled
up in her eyes and trickled down her cheeks. She
took Mary&rsquo;s hand and kissed it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I could kiss you, dearest Mary,&rdquo; she
sobbed; &ldquo;but you see, I&rsquo;ve got such a bad cold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How could she thank Mary for her generous
offer or explain that her family would never allow
her to accept the money, even if she felt she
could herself?</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are the finest, noblest, most generous
girl,&rdquo; she went on brokenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy to do
things for people we love and easier still when
we have the money to do it with. If I hadn&rsquo;t
been so fond of you, Molly, and had been obliged
to deny myself besides, that would have been
generosity. This is only a pleasure. A sort of
self-gratification, because I&rsquo;ve adopted you, you
see, as my little sister.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>Molly lay quietly for a while with her cheek
pressed against Mary&rsquo;s hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you thinking it over?&rdquo; asked Mary at
last, patting her cheek.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking how happy I am,&rdquo; answered
Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As soon as you are well, then,&rdquo; went on Mary,
rising to go, &ldquo;you must have an interview with
Judith and settle the whole thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly smiled up at her friend and squeezed her
hand.</p>

<p>There are times when two friends need not
speak to express what they think.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even if I never win the three golden apples,&rdquo;
she reflected after Mary had gone, &ldquo;I have won
three friends that are as true as gold.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XX.<br />

<small>MISS STEEL.</small></h2>


<p>With the wonderful powers of recuperation
which natures like Molly&rsquo;s have, on Sunday morning
she was up and dressed, almost dancing about
her room in the infirmary, long before it was
time for Dr. McLean to call and grant her permission
to leave.</p>

<p>It was good to be up and well again; it was
good to be at college, for she had been homesick
for Wellington since she had been shut up in the
hospital, and better still, it was good to have
friends, such friends as she had.</p>

<p>As for the emerald ring&mdash;a shadow darkened
her face. The thought of the emerald ring would
push its way into her mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe it will come out all right,&rdquo; she said
to herself. &ldquo;I believe it&mdash;I believe it! I couldn&rsquo;t
help losing it, and if it isn&rsquo;t found, I can&rsquo;t help
that, either. I just won&rsquo;t be miserable, that&rsquo;s all.
I feel too happy and too well.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you at home to visitors this morning,
Miss Brown?&rdquo; asked a sharp unmusical voice at
the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; do come in,&rdquo; answered Molly, rising
to meet Miss Steel, who had walked up the uncarpeted
steps and along the echoing corridor
without making a sound, as usual.</p>

<p>Molly&rsquo;s manners were unfailingly cordial to
visitors, and when she shook hands with Miss
Steel and insisted on making her take the armchair,
that flint-like person visibly softened a little
and faintly smiled. Molly wondered why the
sanitary inspector had called on her, but she appreciated
attentions from anybody and was as
grateful for being popular as if it were something
entirely new and strange to her.</p>

<p>She showed Miss Steel her flowers and pinned
a lovely pink rose on the inspector&rsquo;s granite-colored
cloth coat. She made light of her illness,
and rejoiced that she was returning in a few
hours to dear old Queen&rsquo;s. She was, in fact, so
wonderfully sweet and charming that Sunday
morning that it must have been very difficult even
for the stony inspector to touch on the real business
of her visit.</p>

<p>At last, however, Miss Steel buckled on her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
armor of decision, averted her eyes for a moment
from Molly&rsquo;s glowing face and plunged in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose, Miss Brown, you suspected
my title of &lsquo;Dormitory Inspector&rsquo; here was
merely a nominal one, and that I had another motive
in being at Wellington College?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly hardly liked to tell her that they had
long considered her a spy and detested her for
that reason. She said nothing, therefore, and sat
in her favorite position when listening intently
with her hands clasping one knee and her shoulders
drooping; a very wrong position indeed,
considering that it would eventually make her
round-shouldered and hollow chested; but Molly
was never more graceful or comfortable than
when she adopted this unhealthful attitude.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am an inspector,&rdquo; went on the other, &ldquo;but I
am an inspector of police, that is, a detective.
Doubtless you have heard of certain mysterious
things that have happened at Wellington this
autumn; the attempt to burn the gymnasium,
which we now believe was only a practical joke
to frighten the sophomore class; the cutting of
the electric wires one night, and there are a few
other things you have not heard; for instance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
Miss Walker has received lately several anonymous
letters&mdash;two of them about you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly started.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About me?&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Miss Steel, watching her closely.
&ldquo;But they were not disagreeable letters, strange
to say, since anonymous letters usually are. They
expressed the most ardent admiration for you.
They mentioned that you had enemies who were
trying to ruin your reputation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How absurd!&rdquo; exclaimed Molly indignantly.
She detested anything deceitful and underhand
with all her soul. &ldquo;When did these letters come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just since you have been at the Infirmary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They must be about the emerald ring,&rdquo; broke
in Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; answered the inspector. &ldquo;You have
lost a valuable emerald ring belonging to another
girl who is making it disagreeable for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t want to take care of her ring,&rdquo;
protested Molly. &ldquo;She insisted on it. It was too
big for my finger, and when I fainted it must
have slipped off. I&rsquo;ve done everything I could
to find it, but she needn&rsquo;t worry. She&rsquo;ll be paid
for it, if two acres of good apple orchard that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
were to have paid my college expenses have to
go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, child!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Steel, suddenly
melting into a human being. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
to find that ring for you if it takes the rest of
this winter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly seized her hand joyfully. By one of
those swift flashes of insight which come to us
when we least expect them, it was revealed to
Molly that she had made a friend of the inspector.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been here almost a month,&rdquo; continued
Miss Steel, giving the girl&rsquo;s hand a little vicelike
squeeze, which was her way of expressing cordiality,
&ldquo;and I have found out a great many
things. A girls&rsquo; college is a strange place.
There is a good deal of wire-pulling and petty
jealousy among a certain class of girls, and yet
I have reason to know that the code of honor here
is exceedingly high, and I find myself growing
more and more interested in the girls and their
lives. Nowhere but in college could such devoted
friendships be formed. They are elevating
and fine, especially for selfish girls, who learn
how to be unselfish by example. The girls develop
each other. Your G.&nbsp;F. Society, for instance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
has had a remarkably refining and, shall
I say, quieting effect on Miss Andrews&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly started. She was amazed at the inspector&rsquo;s
insight into the college life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which brings me to the point I have been
aiming to reach. Since I have been here I have
taken pains to learn the history of Miss Andrews
as well as to study her character. She is a
strange girl. Doubtless you know the incident
of last year?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To begin at the beginning: Miss Andrews&rsquo;
parents were rather strange people. Her father
is a city politician who never made any secret of
his grafting methods. Her mother was an
actress and is dead. Frances hadn&rsquo;t been
brought up to any code of honor. She had been
allowed to do as she chose, and had all the money
she wanted to spend. If she is vulgar and pretentious,
it isn&rsquo;t really her fault. Last year she
offended her class by telling a falsehood. She
was under honor, according to the custom here
when a student leaves the premises, to be back
from some visit by ten o&rsquo;clock Sunday night. She
missed the ten o&rsquo;clock train and took the train
which arrived at midnight. However, as luck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
would have it, the ten o&rsquo;clock train was delayed
by a washout and drew into Wellington station
just in front of the train Frances was on. She,
of course, found this out immediately, and taking
advantage of it, she gave out that she had been
on the earlier train, which saved all unnecessary
explanations. It must have been a great temptation
for a girl brought up as she had been. But
truth always comes to the top, sooner or later,
and as the President of her own class happened
to have been on the earlier train, she was found
out. She was summoned by the Student Council,
tried and found guilty. Then she was treated, I
imagine, something in the same way that a
French soldier is expelled from the army. Figuratively
speaking, her sword was broken and
her epaulettes torn from her uniform!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How terrible!&rdquo; exclaimed Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; it was pretty severe. But she was very
defiant, and said dreadful things, denounced her
class and college. Few girls would have had the
courage to return to college next year, but she
came back, hoping to live her dishonor down, and
when she found her class to a member ignored
her very existence, she became almost insane with
bitterness and rage, and having studied her character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
closely, I judge that for a while, until your
secret society took her in hand, she was hardly
responsible for her actions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Miss Walker is very sorry for Frances
Andrews; but she considers her a dangerous element
in college, and at mid-years she would like
some definite reason for asking her not to come
back. I am speaking plainly, because Miss Walker
is convinced that you know a definite reason
and through some mistaken idea of kindness, you
keep it to yourself. In fact, Miss Brown, Miss
Walker is convinced that you and you alone saw
Frances Andrews cut the wires in the gymnasium
that night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; cried Molly, much excited; &ldquo;or,
rather, it wasn&rsquo;t Miss Andrews.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Steel looked at her in surprise, so sure
was she that Molly would confirm her suspicions.</p>

<p>Molly sat down again and clasped her knees
with her long arms. Her cheeks were crimson
and her eyes blazing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who was it, then?&rdquo; asked the inspector.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you that, Miss Steel. If I should
give you the girl&rsquo;s name I should be dishonored
all my life. I have been brought up to believe
that the one who tells is as low as the one who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
did the deed. When we were children, my mother
would never listen to a telltale. I do think it
was a wicked, mischievous thing to have done&mdash;a
contemptible thing; but I&rsquo;d rather you found out
the name of the girl in some other way than
through me, especially right now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why right now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Molly would not reply.</p>

<p>Miss Steel could see nothing but truth in the
depths of Molly&rsquo;s troubled blue eyes. She took
the girl&rsquo;s hand in her&rsquo;s and looked at her gravely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a fine girl, Miss Brown,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;and if you tell me that the girl who cut the
wires was not Miss Andrews, I believe you implicitly.
Of course, Miss Walker would never
tell Miss Andrews not to return to Wellington
without something very definite and tangible on
which to base her dismissal. Luke Andrews, the
girl&rsquo;s father, is as hot-headed and high tempered
as his daughter, and he would probably make a
great deal of trouble and cause a great deal of
publicity if Frances were asked to leave college
quietly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for her,&rdquo; said Molly. &ldquo;I think she
might have been helped if she had had just a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
little more time. After all, the worse thing
about her is her bringing up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And this other girl whom you are shielding,
Miss Brown, does she deserve so much generosity
from you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly closed her lips firmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t the question with me, Miss Steel,&rdquo;
she said at last. &ldquo;The question is: could I ever
show my face again if I told.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But no one need ever know, that is, no one
but the President and me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said Molly wearily.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s with me, you see. I could never be on comfortable
terms with myself again. I should always
be thinking that I hadn&rsquo;t behaved&mdash;well,
like a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the inspector did a most surprising
thing. She went over and kissed Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t for worlds keep you from being
true to yourself, my child,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
a rare quality, and one which will make you devoted
friends all your life, because people will
always know they can trust you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly looked at the inspector, and lo and behold,
a strange transformation had taken place
in that inscrutable, expressionless face. The cold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
gray eyes were softened by a mist of tears and
the thin lips were actually quivering. She looked
almost beautiful at that moment, and Molly suddenly
put her arms around her neck and laid her
head on the flat, hard chest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll forgive me, won&rsquo;t you, Miss Steel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will, indeed, dear,&rdquo; answered the other, patting
Molly&rsquo;s cheek. &ldquo;And now, don&rsquo;t bother
about all this business. Get well and strong.
Don&rsquo;t overwork, and I promise to find that ring
for you if I have to turn the college upside down
to do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she gave Molly a warm, motherly
squeeze, kissed her on the forehead and took her
departure as quietly as she had come.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.<br />

<small>A BACHELOR&rsquo;S POCKET.</small></h2>


<p>Miss Steel was a very busy woman that afternoon.
She was shut up with Judy Kean for half
an hour; she visited the livery stable in the village,
she paid a call on Dr. McLean and finally
she went to see Professor Green.</p>

<p>It is in Professor Green&rsquo;s study on the Cloisters
that we now find her, sitting bolt upright
in her chair, alert and bright-eyed. At such
times as this, Miss Steel is not unlike a hunting
dog on the scent of his quarry.</p>

<p>Professor Green sits at his desk. He looks
tired, and his heavy reddish eyebrows are drawn
together in a frown. When the inspector came
into the room he had pushed a pile of manuscript
under some loose papers, but a sheet had
slipped off and now lay in plain view. Across it
was written in a bold hand:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exeunt FAIRIES in disorder, leaving
WOOD SPRITE at Left Centre.</p>

<p>&ldquo;THE SONG OF THE WOOD SPRITE.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you will pardon this intrusion, Professor.
I see you are very busy,&rdquo; the inspector
began, glancing at the manuscript with a look
of some slight amusement.</p>

<p>The Professor hastily covered up the sheet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; he said politely; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just idling
away a little time. What can I do for you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had seen Miss Steel about the building and
most of the Faculty knew her by this time as
&ldquo;Inspector of Dormitories.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you remember helping a young lady who
fainted on the day of the football game?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, certainly,&rdquo; replied the Professor, absent-mindedly
fingering a paper cutter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You lent her your overcoat that afternoon,
didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes; I believe I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you worn the coat since?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; he answered, laughing; &ldquo;every
day, and several times a day. It&rsquo;s the only one
I have. Are you a detective?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Do you ever put things in the pockets
of your coat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Professor smiled shamefacedly like a
schoolboy culprit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;In one of them. There&rsquo;s been a hole in the
other one for a long time&mdash;two years at least.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you mind letting me see that coat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He lifted the blue overcoat from a hook on the
door and placed it on a chair beside Miss Steel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I a suspect?&rdquo; he asked politely. &ldquo;Has
anything been lost?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The detective seized the overcoat and began
rummaging through the pockets with a practised
hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;something has been
lost, and extremely disagreeable things have been
said by the owner about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About me?&rdquo; asked the Professor, still groping
in the dark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no; about the girl who lost it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Brown?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The detective did not reply. She had run her
hand through the hole in the pocket and was now
searching the corners between the lining and the
cloth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; she cried at last, exactly like the detective
in a play. &ldquo;Here it is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a swift movement she extricated her
hand from the bottomless pocket and displayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
between her thumb and forefinger a large emerald
ring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s the ring of my cousin, Judith
Blount!&rdquo; exclaimed the Professor in amazement.
&ldquo;And I have had it in my pocket all this time.
Great heavens! what an extraordinary thing, and
how did it get there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Blount forced Miss Brown to take
charge of it while she was playing football.
After Miss Brown came to from her faint, she
must have been very cold and slipped her hands
in the pockets of this coat for warmth&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She did,&rdquo; confirmed the Professor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the ring slipped off. When she found
it was lost she got up at dawn next day and
went out in her slippers in the snow to find it,
and nearly caught her death. But she&rsquo;s had no
thanks for her trouble from your relation, I can
assure you. Nothing but abuse&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; shouted the Professor. &ldquo;You mean
to say that Judith has dared to insinuate&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has,&rdquo; said Miss Steel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And she whom Miss Brown has shielded&mdash;great
heavens! this is too much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He began walking up and down the room in a
rage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Shielded from what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not at liberty to tell you,&rdquo; he replied.
&ldquo;The girl repented of what she did. I know
that, but she&rsquo;s an ungrateful little wretch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A scholarly professor of English literature,
however, is no match for a well-trained detective,
and with a knowing smile on her lips the inspector
rose to leave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may return the ring,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It will
be a great relief to Miss Molly Brown of Kentucky
to know it has been found. She was about
to give up two acres of good apple orchard to
pay for it; the land, in fact, which was to provide
the money for her college expenses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with that she sailed out of the room and
went straight to the home of President Walker,
with whom she spent the better part of an hour.</p>

<p>Professor Green followed close on her heels.
He did not pause at Miss Walker&rsquo;s pretty stucco
residence, however, but hastened down the campus
and rang the bell at Queen&rsquo;s Cottage.</p>

<p>Miss Brown was in, he learned from the maid.
She had only arrived from the Infirmary that
afternoon.</p>

<p>The Professor waited in the sitting room deserted
by the students at that hour, those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
were not studying in their rooms being at Vespers.
Presently Molly appeared, looking very
slender and tall, like a pale flower swaying on its
stalk.</p>

<p>The Professor rushed up and seized her hand
unceremoniously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear child!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;how am I ever
going to make my apologies to you for all this
trouble of which I have been the unconscious
cause?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For what&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Molly, too much astonished
to finish her question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ring! The ring! It&rsquo;s been concealed in
the ragged lining of my shabby old overcoat all
this time, and that clever detective of dormitories,
or whatever she is, ferreted it out just
now. Perhaps I should have thought of it myself;
but, you see, I hadn&rsquo;t even heard the ring
had been lost. I am afraid you suffered a great
deal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did at first; but after I grew better I never
let myself slip back into that state again. I kept
believing it would be found. I was so sure of it
that I haven&rsquo;t really been unhappy at all. You
see, everybody is so beautifully kind and no one
believed&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Great heavens!&rdquo; interrupted the Professor,
storming excitedly around the room, &ldquo;that ungrateful,
wicked girl to have made such an accusation&mdash;she
shall hear from me what she owes
to you! I&rsquo;ll take the ring to her myself later.
She is my cousin, and her brother is as near to
me as my own brother, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t going to tell Prexy?&rdquo; cried Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must. Besides, I nearly gave it away to
Miss Steel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, if that&rsquo;s the case, she knows already.
She&rsquo;s a detective, and if you let two
words slip, she can easily guess the rest. There&rsquo;s
no keeping anything from her. You may be
sure Prexy knows it by this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m rather relieved,&rdquo; said the Professor.
&ldquo;Judith will probably be well punished; but she
should be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always wondered,&rdquo; said Molly, after a
short pause, &ldquo;why Judith did it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Professor looked at her closely with his
humorous brown eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you no idea why?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Except for mischief and to annoy the
seniors,&rdquo; she answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A girl who has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
spoiled and petted as she has will give in to almost
any whim that seizes her. However, such
actions are not tolerated at Wellington, and she
will have to learn a few pretty stiff lessons if she
expects to remain here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Professor Green shook hands with
Molly, gave her a little paternal advice about
taking care of her health, and took his departure.
His next destination was the President&rsquo;s
house, where he waited in the drawing-room until
Miss Steel had terminated her interview. He
was prepared for a round scolding from his old
friend, who had known him since his early
youth, but the President was inclined to be
lenient with the young man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It all goes to show,&rdquo; she said at the end of
the interview, &ldquo;that murder will out. But why
did the foolish girl do that mischievous thing?
What did she have to gain by it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jealous of some one prettier and more popular
than herself, probably,&rdquo; he answered.</p>

<p>The President sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who can understand the intricacies of a
young girl&rsquo;s heart,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
studying them for twenty years, and they are
still a closed book to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Professor Green a little later returned
the emerald ring to his cousin, he cut the visit
as short as possible. He told her that she had
deliberately and wrongfully accused one who had
shielded her even at the risk of offending the
President of Wellington College, and that it was
he who had given the detective, already suspicious,
the clue she wanted.</p>

<p>Judith wept bitterly, but her cousin showed no
signs of relenting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you want to be loved,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;learn unselfishness
and gentleness and truthfulness.
These are the qualities that make men and
women beloved. You will never gain anything
by cheating and lying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The end of the episode was a pretty severe
punishment for Judith Blount. She was suspended
from college for three weeks and was
compelled to resign from all societies for the rest
of the winter. She left college next morning
early, and no one saw her again until after
Christmas, when she returned a much chastened
and quieted young woman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>A few days after she had gone Molly received
a note from her from New York. It read:</p>

<div class="smallnote"><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Miss Brown</span>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you forgive me? I am very unhappy.</p>

<p><span class="rght1">&ldquo;Judith Blount.&rdquo;</span><br /></p></div>

<p>You may be sure that Molly&rsquo;s reply was
prompt and forgiving.</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XXII.<br />

<small>CHRISTMAS&mdash;MID-YEARS&mdash;AND THE WANDERTHIRST.</small></h2>


<p>There are few lonelier and more dismal experiences
in life than Christmas away from home
for the first time. Molly felt her heart sink as
the great day approached. One morning a trainload
of chattering, laughing girls pulled out of
the Wellington station. Judy hanging recklessly
to the last step, waved her handkerchief until
Molly&rsquo;s figure grew indistinct in the distance,
and Nance on the crowded platform called out
again and again, &ldquo;Good-bye, Molly, dear. Good-bye!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly almost regretted that she had ever left
Kentucky, as the Christmas train became a point
of black on the horizon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I might have ended my days as a teacher in
a country school-house and been happier than
this,&rdquo; she thought desperately, starting back to
college.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>Some one came running up behind her. It was
Mary Stewart who had been down to see some
classmates off. She was to take the night train
to New York.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When do you get off?&rdquo; she asked, slipping
her arm through Molly&rsquo;s like the good comrade
she was. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised you didn&rsquo;t leave yesterday,
with such a long journey before you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going home this Christmas,&rdquo; replied
Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not going?&rdquo; began Mary. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re to be left
at Queen&rsquo;s by yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly nodded, vainly endeavoring to smile
cheerfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re to go with me. I&rsquo;ll come right
along now and help you pack,&rdquo; announced Mary
decisively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Mary, I can&rsquo;t. I haven&rsquo;t anything&mdash;money
or clothes&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say &lsquo;but&rsquo; to me! I&rsquo;ve got everything.
I&rsquo;ve even got the drawing-room to myself on the
night train to New York. You shall go with me.
I don&rsquo;t know why I never thought of it before.
We&rsquo;ll have a beautiful Christmas together.
Since mother&rsquo;s death, five years ago, Christmas
has been a dismal time at our house. You&rsquo;ll be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
just the person to cheer us up. It will be like
having a child in the house. You shall have a
Christmas tree and hang up your stocking. Father
will be delighted and so will Brother
Willie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus overruled, Molly was borne triumphantly
to New York that same evening, and spent one
of the most wonderful Christmases of her life in
Mary&rsquo;s beautiful home on Riverside Drive. As
her mother and godmother both wisely sent her
checks for Christmas gifts, she was not embarrassed
by any lack of ready money. She was
even rich enough to purchase a new evening
dress and a pretty blouse which Mary had ordered
to be sent up on approval, and not for
many a year afterward did she guess why those
charming things happened to be such bargains.
But Molly was a very inexperienced young person,
and knew little concerning prices at that
time.</p>

<p>Mary&rsquo;s father was a fine man, quiet and self-contained,
with a splendid rugged face. He
treated his only daughter with indescribable tenderness,
and called her &ldquo;Little Mary.&rdquo; They did
not see much of &ldquo;Brother Willie,&rdquo; a sophomore
at Yale, and very busy enjoying his holiday. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
regarded Molly as a child and his sister as an old
maid, but condescended to take them to the theatre
twice.</p>

<p>But all good things must come to an end, and
it seemed just a little while before Molly found
herself back at her old desk in her room at
Queen&rsquo;s, writing a &ldquo;bread-and-butter&rdquo; letter to
Mr. Stewart, which pleased him mightily, since
Mary&rsquo;s guests had never before taken that
trouble.</p>

<p>Judy came back radiantly happy. She had had
a glorious time in Washington with her &ldquo;vagabond&rdquo;
parents, as she called them. Nance, too,
had enjoyed her Christmas with her father and
busy mother, who had come home to rest during
the holidays. Only one of Queen&rsquo;s girls did not
join the jolly circle that now congregated in the
most hospitable room in the house to &ldquo;swap&rdquo;
holiday experiences. But a letter had arrived
from the missing member addressed to &ldquo;Miss M.&nbsp;
C.&nbsp;W. Brown,&rdquo; and beginning: &ldquo;My Dear Molly
Brown.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; the letter ran. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m off for
Europe and Grandmamma, by the <cite>Kismet</cite>, sailing
the eighteenth. I am afraid I was too much
like a bull in a china shop at college. I was always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
breaking something, mostly rules. I&rsquo;ve
done lots of foolish things, and I am sorry. They
were jokes, of course, most of them, and intended
to frighten silly self-important people. I&rsquo;ve
learned a great deal from you and your friends,
but I&rsquo;d rather practice my new wisdom on other
people. If you ever see me again you&rsquo;ll find me
changed. I may enter a convent for a few years
in France and learn to keep quiet. You did what
you could for me, and so did the others. You
are a first rate lot and you make a jolly good
freshman class. I shall miss you, and I shall
miss old Wellington. I wouldn&rsquo;t have come back
this year if I hadn&rsquo;t felt the call of its two gray
towers. Somehow, it&rsquo;s been more of a home to
me than most places, and when I&rsquo;m quite old and
forgotten I shall go back and see it again some
day. Good-bye again, and good luck. I&rsquo;ve told
Mrs. Murphy to give you my Persian prayer
rug. It&rsquo;s just your color of blue.</p>

<p><span class="rght1">&ldquo;F. Andrews.&rdquo;</span><br />

<p>Molly read the letter aloud and the girls were
half sorry and half relieved over its contents.
After all, Frances was a very disturbing element,
but as Margaret Wakefield announced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
later at a meeting of the G.&nbsp;F. Society, she had
responded to kind treatment, and she, Margaret,
moved that they send her a combination steamer
letter of farewell and a bunch of violets to cheer
her on her lonely voyage. The movement was
promptly seconded by Molly, carried by universal
acclaim, and the resolution put into effect immediately.</p>

<p>After Christmas comes the terror of every
freshman&rsquo;s heart&mdash;the mid-year examinations.
As the dreaded week approached, lights burned
late in every house on the campus and nobody
offered any interference. Behind closed doors
sat scores of weary maidens with pale concentrated
faces bent over text-books.</p>

<p>Judy Kean made a record at Queen&rsquo;s. She
crammed history for thirty-six hours at a
stretch, only stopping for food occasionally or to
snatch a half hour&rsquo;s nap.</p>

<p>It was Saturday and bitter cold. Examinations
were to begin on Monday, and there yet remained
two more blessed days of respite. Molly,
in a long, gray dressing gown, with a towel
wrapped around her head, had been cramming
mathematics since six in the morning, and now
at eleven o&rsquo;clock, she lifted her eyes from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
hated volume and looked about her with a dazed
expression as if she had suddenly awakened from
a black dream. Nance had hurried into the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Molly, for heaven&rsquo;s sake, go to Judy. I think
she&rsquo;s losing her mind. She has overstudied and
it has affected her brain. I can&rsquo;t do anything
with her at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried Molly, rushing down the hall,
her long, gray wrapper trailing after her in
voluminous folds.</p>

<p>She opened Judy&rsquo;s door unceremoniously and
marched in.</p>

<p>The room looked as if a cyclone had struck it.
The contents of the bureau drawers were
dumped onto the floor; the closet was emptied,
clothes and books piled about on the bed and
chairs, and Judy&rsquo;s two trunks filled up what floor
space remained.</p>

<p>Judy herself was working feverishly. She
had packed a layer of books in one of the trunks
and was now folding up her best dresses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Julia Kean, what are you doing?&rdquo; cried
Molly in a stern voice.</p>

<p>Judy gave her a constrained nod.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother me now. There&rsquo;s a dear. I&rsquo;m
in a dreadful hurry.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>Molly shook her violently by the shoulder. She
had a feeling that Judy was asleep and must be
waked up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get up from there this minute and answer my
question,&rdquo; she commanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was your question?&rdquo; asked Judy with
an embarrassed little laugh. &ldquo;Oh, yes, you asked
what I was doing. I should think you could see
I wasn&rsquo;t gathering cowslips on the campus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you running away, Judy?&rdquo; asked Molly,
trying another tack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my Mariucci,&rdquo; cried Judy, quoting a
popular song, &ldquo;&lsquo;<cite>I&rsquo;m gona packa my trunk and
taka my monk and sail for sunny It.</cite>&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly refused even to smile at this witticism.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know what you&rsquo;re doing,&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;You are running away from examinations.
You&rsquo;re a coward. You are no better than a deserter
from the army in time of war. It&rsquo;s bad
enough in time of peace, but just before the battle&mdash;I&rsquo;m
so ashamed and disappointed in you
that I can hardly understand how I ever could
have loved you so much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy went on stolidly packing, rolling her
clothes into little bundles and stuffing them in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
anywhere she could find a place between her numerous
books.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you lost your nerve, Judy, dear?&rdquo; said
Molly, after a minute, kneeling down beside her
friend and seizing her hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; said Judy, extricating her
hands, and speaking in a hard, strained voice in
an effort to keep from breaking down. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
rather not stay here and be disgraced by flunking,
but there&rsquo;s another reason beside that, Molly.
I know I look like a deserter and deserve to be
shot, but there&rsquo;s another reason,&rdquo; she wailed;
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s another good reason.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Judy, dearest, what can it be?&rdquo; asked
Molly gently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re going to Italy,&rdquo; she burst out.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re sailing on Monday. I got the letter to-day,
and, oh, I can&rsquo;t stand it&mdash;I can&rsquo;t endure it.
They&rsquo;ll be in Sicily in a few weeks&mdash;and without
me! Mamma hates the cold. So do I. I&rsquo;m
numb now with it. Oh, Molly, they&rsquo;ll be sailing
without me, and I want to go. You can&rsquo;t understand
what the feeling is. There is something in
me that is calling all the time, and I can&rsquo;t help
hearing it and answering. In my mind I can live
through every bit of the voyage. At first it&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
cold, bitter cold, and then after a few days we
get into the Gulf Stream and gradually it grows
warmer. Even in the winter time the air is soft
and smells of the south. At last the Azores
come&mdash;cunning little islands snuggling down out
there in the Atlantic&mdash;and finally you see a long
line of coast&mdash;it&rsquo;s Africa; then Gibraltar and the
Mediterranean&mdash;oh, Molly&mdash;and Algiers, lovely
Algiers, nestling down between the hills and
looking across such a harbor! You can see the
domes of the mosques as you sail in and Arab
boys come out in funny little boats and offer to
row you to shore. It&rsquo;s delightfully warm and
you smell flowers everywhere. The sky is a deep
blue. It&rsquo;s like June. And then, after Algiers,
comes Italy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy had risen to her feet now, and her eyes
had an uncanny expression in them. She appeared
to have lost sight entirely of the little
room at Queen&rsquo;s, and through the chaos of books
and clothing, she was seeing a vision of the
South.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come back to earth, Judy,&rdquo; said Molly, gently
pulling her sleeve. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t your mother and
father be angry with you for giving up college
and joining them uninvited?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Angry?&rdquo; cried Judy. &ldquo;Of course not. Even
if I just caught the steamer, it would be all right,
they would fix it up somehow, and they would
be glad&mdash;oh, so glad! What a glorious time we
will have together. Perhaps we shall spend a
few weeks in Capri. I shall try and make them
stay a while in Capri. Such a view there is at
Capri across the Bay. Papa loves Naples. He
even loves its dirtiness and calls it &lsquo;local color.&rsquo;
We&rsquo;ll have to stay there a week to satisfy him,
and then mamma will make us go to Ravello.
She&rsquo;s mad about it; and then I&rsquo;ll have my choice&mdash;it&rsquo;s
Venice, of course; but we&rsquo;ll wait until it&rsquo;s
warmer for Venice. April is perfect there, and
then Rome after Easter. Oh, Molly, Molly, help
me pack! I&rsquo;m off&mdash;I&rsquo;m off&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it glorious,
Italy, when the spring begins, the roses and the
violets and the fresias&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy began running about the room, snatching
her things from the bed and chairs and tossing
them into the trunks helter-skelter. Molly
watched her in silence for a while. She must collect
her ideas, and think of something to say.
But not now. It was like arguing with a lunatic
to say anything now.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>At last Judy&rsquo;s feverish energy burned itself
out and she sat down on the bed exhausted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re going to give up four splendid
years at college and all the friends you&rsquo;ve made&mdash;Nance
and me and Margaret and Jessie, and
nice old Sallie Marks and Mabel, all the fun and
the jolly times, the delightful, glorious life we
have here&mdash;and for what? For a three months&rsquo;
trip you have taken before, and will take again
often, no doubt. Just for three short, paltry
little months&rsquo; pleasure, you&rsquo;re going to give up
things that will be precious to you for the rest
of your life. It&rsquo;s not only the book learning, it&rsquo;s
the associations and the friends&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why I should lose my friends,&rdquo;
broke in Judy sullenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll never be the same again. They
couldn&rsquo;t after such a disappointment as this. You
see, you&rsquo;ll always be remembered as a coward
who turned and ran when examinations came&mdash;you
lost your nerve and dropped out and even
pretty little Jessie has the courage to face it. Oh,
Judy, but I&rsquo;m disappointed in you. It&rsquo;s a hard
blow to come now when we&rsquo;re all fighting to save
ourselves and pull through safely. And you&mdash;one
of the cleverest and brightest girls in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
class. Don&rsquo;t tell me your father will be pleased.
He&rsquo;ll be mortified, I&rsquo;m certain of it. He&rsquo;s much
too fine a man to admire a cowardly act, no matter
whose act it is. You&rsquo;ll see. He&rsquo;ll be shocked
and hurt. If he had thought it was right for
you to give up college on the eve of examinations,
he would have written for you to come. It
will be a crushing blow to him, Judy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy lay on her bed, her hands clasped back
of her head. There was a defiant look on her
face, and she kicked the quilt up and down with
one foot, like an impatient horse pawing the
ground. Then, suddenly, she collapsed like a
pricked balloon. Burying her face in the pillows,
she began sobbing bitterly, her body shaking
convulsively with every sob. It was a terrible
sight to see Judy cry, and Molly hoped she would
be spared such another experience.</p>

<p>Without saying another word, Molly began
quietly unpacking the trunks and putting the
things back in their places. Then she pulled the
empty trunks into the hall. This done, she filled
a basin with water, recklessly poured in an ample
quantity of Judy&rsquo;s German cologne, and sitting
on the side of the bed, began bathing her
friend&rsquo;s convulsed and swollen face. Gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
Judy&rsquo;s sobs subsided, her weary eyelids drooped
and presently she dropped off into a deep, exhausted
sleep.</p>

<p>Nance crept into the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s all right now,&rdquo; whispered Molly.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s had an attack of the &lsquo;wanderthirst,&rsquo; but
it&rsquo;s passed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All day and all night Judy slept, and on Sunday
morning she was her old self once more, gay
and laughing and full of fun. That afternoon
she was an usher at Vespers in Wellington
Chapel, with Molly and Nance, and wore her best
suit and a big black velvet hat.</p>

<p>She never alluded again to her attack of wanderthirst,
but her devotion to Molly deepened
and strengthened as the days flew by until it became
as real to her as her love for her mother
and father.</p>

<p>Once in the midst of the dreaded examinations
they did not seem so dreadful after all. The girls
at Queen&rsquo;s came out of the fight with &ldquo;some
wounds, but still breathing,&rdquo; as Margaret Wakefield
had put it. Molly had a condition in mathematics.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got it because I expected it,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>But Judy came through with flying colors&mdash;not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
a single black mark against her. Jessie
barely pulled through, and her friends rejoiced
that the prettiest, most frivolous member of the
freshman class had made such a valiant fight
and won.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.<br />

<small>SOPHOMORES AT LAST.</small></h2>


<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;Freshman, arise!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gird on thy sword!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Captivity is o&rsquo;er.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To arms! To arms!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, lo! thou art<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A daring sophomore!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The words of this stirring song floated in
through the open windows at Queen&rsquo;s one warm
night in early June. Moonlight flooded the campus,
and the air was sweet with the perfume of
lilac and syringa.</p>

<p>A group of sophomores had gathered in front
of the house to serenade the freshmen at
Queen&rsquo;s, who had immediately repaired to the
piazza to acknowledge this unusual honor paid
them by their august predecessors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it would be far more appropriate if
they sang:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0b">&ldquo;&lsquo;When all the saints who from their labors
rest,&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>remarked Mabel Hinton, who, in order to make
a record, had studied herself into a human skeleton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Molly Brown, &ldquo;when I left home
last September, one of my brothers cheerfully
informed me that I looked like &lsquo;a rag and a bone
and a hank of hair.&rsquo; I am afraid I don&rsquo;t feel
very saint-like now, because I have gained ten
pounds, and I&rsquo;m not tired of anything, except
packing my clothes. I&rsquo;m so sorry to leave blessed
old Queen&rsquo;s that I could kiss her brown cheek, if
it didn&rsquo;t look foolish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, go and kiss the side of the house then,&rdquo;
put in Judy. &ldquo;You have a poetic nature, Molly;
but I wouldn&rsquo;t have it changed. I like it just as
it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; interrupted Margaret Wakefield,
&ldquo;that Queen&rsquo;s, from having once been
scorned as a residence, has now become a very
popular abode, and there were so many applications
for rooms here for next year that the registrar
has had to make a waiting list for the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
time in connection with Queen&rsquo;s. Think of that
at old Queen&rsquo;s!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s the residence of a distinguished
person,&rdquo; announced Molly. &ldquo;I think we
should put a brass plate on the front door, stating
that in this house lived a class president who
possessed every attribute for the office. She
was versed in parliamentary law, she had an
executive mind, and she was beloved by all who
knew her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Margaret was pleased at this compliment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voyons, voyons, que vous me flattez!&rdquo;</i> she exclaimed.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your warm Southern nature that
makes you so enthusiastic. Now, the real reason
why old brown Queen&rsquo;s, with her moldering
vines, is so popular all of a sudden is because
you are here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was Molly&rsquo;s turn now to be pleased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t argue such a personal matter,&rdquo; she
said, squeezing Margaret&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m glad
I&rsquo;m booked here for next year. I was afraid
Nance would want a &lsquo;singleton,&rsquo; she has such a
retiring nun-like nature.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; exclaimed Nance, disregarding English
in her amazement. &ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;ve had the happiest
winter of my whole life with you, Molly. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
there&rsquo;s a chance for another one like it, I&rsquo;m only
too thankful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly Mary Carmichael Washington
Brown is a modest soul,&rdquo; thought Judy, who
happened to know that her friend had had some
five or six tempting offers to move into better
quarters the next year at no greater expense to
herself. One was from Mary Stewart, who was
to return next winter for a post-graduate course.
Another was from Judith Blount, who had proposed
Molly for membership in the Beta Phi Society
next year, and had furthermore invited the
surprised young freshman to take the study of
her apartment for a bedroom and offered her the
constant use of her sumptuous sitting room.</p>

<p>Certainly, if ever there was an expression of
true remorse and repentance, that was one, Molly
thought, and the allusion to roommates reminded
her that she must say good-bye to Judith, for
there would be no time in the morning for last
farewells.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going over to the Beta Phi house for a
minute,&rdquo; she announced. &ldquo;Any one want to come
along?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Margaret and Jessie, who had friends in that
&ldquo;abode of fashion,&rdquo; as it was called, joined her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
and presently the three white figures were lost
in the shadows on the campus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is going to say farewell to black-eyed
Judith,&rdquo; observed Judy in a low voice to Nance,
&ldquo;and all I would say is what the colored preacher
said: &lsquo;Can the le-o-pard change his spots?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nance smiled gravely. She did not possess
Judy&rsquo;s prejudiced nature, but her convictions
were strong.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think she&rsquo;s a &lsquo;le-o-pard,&rsquo; Judy?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She may be a domesticated one,&rdquo; said Judy,
&ldquo;of the genus known as &lsquo;cat.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you ashamed, Judy?&rdquo; exclaimed
Nance, reprovingly.</p>

<p>But it must be confessed that a few doubts
still lurked in her own heart concerning the sincerity
of proud Judith&rsquo;s repentance.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the three freshmen had separated
in the upper hall of the Beta Phi House,
and Molly had given a timid rap with Judith&rsquo;s
fine brass knocker.</p>

<p>Instantly the door flew open and she found
herself precipitated into a roomful of people, at
least it seemed so at first, who had just subsided
into quiet because some one was going to play.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>Molly was about to retreat in great confusion
when Miss Grace Green seized one hand and
Mary Stewart the other. Judith came forward
with a show of extreme cordiality and Richard
Blount left the piano and actually ran the full
length of the room, exclaiming:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Miss Molly Brown of Kentucky!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly knew she was breaking into a party,
but there was nothing to do but make a call of
a few minutes and then take her leave as gracefully
as possible under the circumstances.</p>

<p>Professor Edwin Green had also shaken her
by the hand warmly, and pushing up a chair had
insisted on her sitting down. They had all
drawn their chairs around her in a semicircle,
and Richard Blount had brought over the piano
stool and placed it directly in front of her so that
he could look straight at her.</p>

<p>In fact, here sat the little freshman, blushing
crimson and painfully embarrassed, enthroned
in a large armchair, and gathered around her
was a circle of very delightful, not to say, admiring
persons.</p>

<p>As one of these persons was Judith&rsquo;s brother
and two were her near cousins, Molly thought
she could explain their excessive cordiality. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
knew the story of the ring and they were anxious
to make amends.</p>

<p>She recalled, with a furtive inner smile, the
last time she was in those rooms, when, as a
waitress, she had upset the coffee on the Professor&rsquo;s
knees. How glad she was that the painful
experience was well over and forgotten by now.
But she was glad about many things that evening.
She was happy to see that Mary and Judith
had made up their differences, and were
once more friends. She knew that Mary, who
had the kindest heart in the world, could never
stay angry long.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that Judith was giving a
party,&rdquo; Molly began, still very much embarrassed.
&ldquo;I just dropped in to say good-bye because
I am leaving to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-morrow morning?&rdquo; repeated Richard
Blount. &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it lucky for me you happened
in to-night. I had expected to call on you to-morrow
afternoon, and think how disappointed I
should have been to have found the nest empty
and the bird flown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you are really off to-morrow?&rdquo; broke in
Professor Green. &ldquo;I am so sorry. I was going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
to ask you to have tea in the Cloisters with my
sister and me in the afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again Molly smiled to herself. Tea in the
Cloisters, with a distinguished professor and his
charming sister! Only nine months before she
had been a lonely, shivering little waif of a freshman
locked in the Cloisters. The words of the
sophomore &ldquo;croak&rdquo; came back to her:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;They have locked me in the Cloisters;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They have fastened up the gate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, let me out! Oh, let me out!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It&rsquo;s growing very late.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry that my ticket is bought and my
berth engaged, and the expressman coming for
my trunk to-morrow at nine,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If all
those things were not so, I should love to drink
soup&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she stopped and flushed a deep red.</p>

<p>What absurd trick of the mind had made her say
&ldquo;soup&rdquo;? &ldquo;I mean tea,&rdquo; she went on hastily,
hoping no one had heard the break.</p>

<p>Miss Green was talking with Mary Stewart.
Richard Blount was twirling on the piano stool,
his hands deep in his pockets, and Judith was engaged
at a side table in pouring lemonade into
glasses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a twinkle of amusement in the Professor&rsquo;s
brown eyes, and he gave Molly a delightful
smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must be going,&rdquo; she said anxiously, rising.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not till you&rsquo;ve had a glass of lemonade, for I
made it myself,&rdquo; said Richard, gallantly handing
her one on a plate.</p>

<p>Molly looked doubtfully toward Judith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be like that young man in
the rhyme,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0b">&ldquo;&lsquo;There was a young man so benighted,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He never knew when he was slighted.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He&rsquo;d go to a party and eat just as hearty,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if he&rsquo;d been really invited.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Everybody laughed, and Judith suddenly becoming
a model hostess, exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, you must stay, Molly, and have some
lemonade. Richard didn&rsquo;t make it at all. He
only squeezed the lemons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly, therefore, remained and had a beautiful
time, and when she really did take her departure
the entire party, including Judith, escorted her
across the moonlit campus to the door of Queen&rsquo;s.
But Molly was still certain that it was the ring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
episode and nothing else that made them all so
polite and attentive.</p>

<p>And so she informed Nance and Judy that
night as she unlocked her trunk for the third
time in ten minutes to stuff in some overlooked
belonging.</p>

<p>But Judy sniffed the air and exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ring, nothing! It&rsquo;s popularity!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly smiled and went to bed, feeling that her
last day at Wellington had been a decided improvement
on the first one.</p>

<p>The next morning Queen&rsquo;s Cottage was a pandemonium
of trunks and bags and excited young
women, rushing up and down the halls. Cries
could be heard from every room in the house of:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The laundress hasn&rsquo;t brought my shirtwaists!
Perfidious woman!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The expressman&rsquo;s here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is your trunk strapped?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to sleep in an upper berth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget to write me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are you to be this summer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get this top down and the trunk man&rsquo;s
waiting!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, do hurry! We&rsquo;ll miss the bus!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Young ladies, the bus is coming,&rdquo; called the
voice of Mrs. Markham from the front door.</p>

<p>And then, with a fluttering of handkerchiefs
and many a last call of &ldquo;good-bye,&rdquo; the bus-load
of girls moved sedately down the avenue.</p>

<p>Molly, looking back at the twin gray towers of
Wellington, understood why Frances Andrews
wanted so much to return.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How glad I am to be only a sophomore,&rdquo; she
cried. &ldquo;I shall have three more years at Wellington!&rdquo;</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
